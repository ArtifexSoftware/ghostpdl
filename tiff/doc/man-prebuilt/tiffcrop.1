.TH "TIFFCROP" "1" "Sep 11, 2024" "4.7" "LibTIFF"
.SH NAME
tiffcrop \- select, copy, crop, convert, extract, and/or process one or more TIFF files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBtiffcrop\fP [ \fIoptions\fP ] \fIsrc1.tif\fP â€¦ \fIsrcN.tif\fP \fIdst.tif\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBtiffcrop\fP processes one or more files created according
to the Tag Image File Format, Revision 6.0, specification
into one or more TIFF file(s).
\fBtiffcrop\fP is most often used to extract portions of an image for processing
with bar code recognizer or OCR software when that software cannot
restrict the region of interest to a specific portion of the image
or to improve efficiency when the regions of interest must be rotated.
It can also be used to subdivide all or part of a processed image into
smaller sections and export individual images or sections of images
as separate files or separate images within one or more files derived
from the original input image or images.
.sp
The available functions can be grouped broadly into three classes:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Those that select individual images or sections of images from the input files.
The options \fI\%\-N\fP for sequences or lists of individual images in the input files,
\fI\%\-Z\fP for zones, \fI\%\-z\fP for regions, \fI\%\-X\fP and \fI\%\-Y\fP for fixed sized selections,
\fI\%\-m\fP for margins, \fI\%\-U\fP for units, and \fI\%\-E\fP for edge reference provide a variety of
ways to specify portions of the input image.
.IP 2. 3
Those that allow the individual images or selections to be exported to one or
more output files in different groupings and control the organization of the
data in the output images. The options \fI\%\-P\fP for page size grouping, \fI\%\-S\fP for
subdivision into columns and rows and \fI\%\-e\fP for export mode options that produce
one or more files from each input image. The options \fI\%\-r\fP, \fI\%\-s\fP, \fI\%\-t\fP, \fI\%\-w\fP  control
strip and tile format and sizes while \fI\%\-B\fP, \fI\%\-L\fP, \fI\%\-c\fP, \fI\%\-f\fP modify the endian addressing
scheme, the compression options, and the bit fill sequence of images as they
are written.
.IP 3. 3
Those that perform some action on each image that is selected from the input file.
The options include \fI\%\-R\fP for rotate, \fI\%\-I\fP for inversion of the photometric
interpretation and/or data values, and \fI\%\-F\fP to flip (mirror) the image horizontally
or vertically.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Functions are applied to the input image(s) in the following order:
cropping, fixed area extraction, zone and region extraction,
inversion, mirroring, rotation.
.sp
Functions are applied to the output image(s) in the following order:
export mode options for grouping zones, regions, or images into
one or more files, \fIor\fP row and column divisions with output margins,
\fIor\fP page size divisions with page orientation options.
.sp
Finally, strip, tile, byte order, output resolution, and compression options are
applied to all output images.
.sp
The output file(s) may be organized and compressed using a different
algorithm from the input files.
By default, \fBtiffcrop\fP will copy all the understood tags in a TIFF
directory of an input file to the associated directory in the output file.
Options can be used to force the resultant image to be written as strips
or tiles of data, respectively.
.sp
\fBtiffcrop\fP can be used to reorganize the storage characteristics of data
in a file, and to reorganize, extract, rotate, and otherwise
process the image data as specified at the same time whereas
\fBtiffcp\fP does not alter the image data within the file.
.sp
Using the options for selecting individual input images and the
options for exporting images and/or segments defined as zones or
regions of each input image, \fBtiffcrop\fP can perform the
functions of \fBtiffcp\fP and \fBtiffsplit\fP in a single pass
while applying multiple operations to individual selections or images.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-h
Display the syntax summary for tiffcrop.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-v
Report the current version and last modification date for tiffcrop.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-N odd|even|#,#\-#,#|last
Specify one or more series or range(s) of images within each file to process.
The words \fBodd\fP or \fBeven\fP
may be used to specify all odd or even numbered images counting from one.
Note that internally, TIFF images are numbered from zero rather than one
but since this convention is not obvious to most users, \fBtiffcrop\fP used 1
to specify the first image in a multipage file.  The word \fBlast\fP
may be used in place of a number in the sequence to indicate the
final image in the file without knowing how many images there are.
Ranges of images may be specified with a dash and multiple sets
can be indicated by joining them in a comma\-separated list. eg. use
\fB\-N 1,5\-7,last\fP
to process the 1st, 5th through 7th, and final image in the file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-E top|bottom|left|right
Specify the \fBtop\fP, \fBbottom\fP, \fBleft\fP, or \fBright\fP edge as the reference from
which to calculate the width and length of crop regions or sequence
of positions for zones. When used with the \fI\%\-e\fP option for exporting
zones or regions, the reference edge determines how composite images
are arranged. Using \fB\-E left\fP or \fB\-E right\fP causes successive zones or
regions to be merged horizontally whereas using \fB\-E top\fP or \fB\-E bottom\fP
causes successive zones or regions to be arranged vertically. This
option has no effect on export layout when multiple zones or regions
are not being exported to composite images. Edges may be abbreviated
to the first letter.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-e combined|divided|image|multiple|separate
Specify the export mode for images and selections from input images.
The final filename on the command line is considered to be the
destination file or filename stem for automatically generated
sequences of files. Modes may be abbreviated to the first letter.

.TP
.B \-U in|cm|px
Specify the type of units to apply to dimensions for margins and
crop regions for input and output images. Inches or centimeters
are converted to pixels using the resolution unit specified in the
TIFF file (which defaults to inches if not specified in the IFD).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-m top,left,bottom,right
Specify margins to be removed from the input image. The order must
be \fItop\fP, \fIleft\fP, \fIbottom\fP, \fIright\fP with only commas separating the elements
of the list. Margins are scaled according to the current units and
removed before any other extractions are computed.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-X #
Set the horizontal (X\-axis) dimension of a region to extract relative to
the specified origin reference. If the origin is the top or bottom
edge, the X axis value will be assumed to start at the left edge.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-Y #
Set the vertical (Y\-axis) dimension of a region to extract relative to
the specified origin reference. If the origin is the left or right
edge, the Y axis value will be assumed to start at the top.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-Z  #:#,#:#
Specify zones of the image designated as position X of Y equal sized portions
measured from the reference edge,  eg 1:3 would be first third of the
image starting from the reference edge minus any margins specified
for the confining edges. Multiple zones can be specified as a comma
separated list but they must reference the same edge. To extract the
top quarter and the bottom third of an image you would use
\fB\-Z 1:4,3:3\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-z x1,y1,x2,y2: ... :xN,yN,xN+1,yN+1
Specify a series of coordinates to define regions for processing and exporting.
The coordinates represent the top left and lower right corners of each region
in the current units, eg inch, cm, or pixels. Pixels are counted from one to
width or height and inches or cm are calculated from image resolution data.
.sp
Each colon delimited series of four values represents the horizontal and vertical
offsets from the top and left edges of the image, regardless of the edge specified
with the \fI\%\-E\fP option. The first and third values represent the horizontal offsets of
the corner points from the left edge while the second and fourth values represent
the vertical offsets from the top edge.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.B \-F horiz|vert
Flip, ie mirror, the image or extracted region horizontally or vertically.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0

.B \-R 90|180|270
Rotate the image or extracted region 90, 180, or 270 degrees clockwise.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-I [black|white|data|both]
Invert color space, eg dark to light for bilevel and grayscale images.
This can be used to modify negative images to positive or to correct
images that have the \fBPHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION\fP tag set incorrectly.
If the value is black or white, the \fBPHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION\fP tag is set to
MinIsBlack or MinIsWhite, without altering the image data. If the argument
is data or both, the data values of the image are modified. Specifying both
inverts the data and the \fBPHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION\fP tag, whereas using data
inverts the data but not the \fBPHOTOMETRIC_INTERPRETATION\fP tag.
No support for modifying the color space of color images in this release.

.B \-c
Specify the compression to use for data written to the output file:
\fB\-c none\fP for no compression,
\fB\-c packbits\fP for PackBits compression,
\fB\-c lzw\fP for Lempel\-Ziv & Welch compression,
\fB\-c jpeg\fP for baseline JPEG compression.
\fB\-c zip\fP for Deflate compression,
\fB\-c g3\fP for CCITT Group 3 (T.4) compression,
\fB\-c g4\fP for CCITT Group 4 (T.6) compression.
By default \fBtiffcrop\fP will compress data according to the value of the
\fBCompression\fP tag found in the source file.
.sp
The CCITT Group 3 and Group 4 compression algorithms can only
be used with bilevel data.
.sp
Group 3 compression can be specified together with several
T.4\-specific options:
\fB1d\fP for 1\-dimensional encoding,
\fB2d\fP for 2\-dimensional encoding,
\fBfill\fP to force each encoded scanline to be zero\-filled so that the
terminating EOL code lies on a byte boundary.
Group 3\-specific options are specified by appending a \fB:\fP\-separated
list to the \fBg3\fP option; e.g. \fB\-c g3:2d:fill\fP
to get 2D\-encoded data with byte\-aligned EOL codes.
.sp
LZW compression can be specified together with a \fBpredictor\fP
value. A predictor value of 2 causes
each scanline of the output image to undergo horizontal
differencing before it is encoded; a value
of 1 forces each scanline to be encoded without differencing.
LZW\-specific options are specified by appending a \fB:\fP\-separated
list to the \fBlzw\fP option; e.g. \fB\-c lzw:2\fP for LZW
compression with horizontal differencing.

.SH NOTES
.sp
In general, bilevel, grayscale, palette and RGB(A) data with bit depths
from 1 to 32 bits should work in both interleaved and separate plane
formats. Unlike \fBtiffcp\fP, \fBtiffcrop\fP can read and write tiled images with
bits per sample that are not a multiple of 8 in both interleaved and
separate planar format. Floating point data types are supported at
bit depths of 16, 24, 32 and 64 bits per sample.
.sp
Not all images can be converted from one compression scheme to another.
Data with some photometric interpretations and/or bit depths are tied to
specific compression schemes and vice\-versa, e.g. Group 3/4 compression
is only usable for bilevel data. JPEG compression is only usable on 8
bit per sample data (or 12 bit if \fBlibtiff\fP
was compiled with 12 bit JPEG support). Support for OJPEG compressed
images is problematic at best. Since OJPEG compression is no longer
supported for writing images with LibTIFF, these images will be updated
to the newer JPEG compression when they are copied or processed. This
may cause the image to appear color shifted or distorted after conversion.
In some cases, it is possible to remove the original compression from
image data using the option \fB\-c none\fP\&.
.sp
\fBtiffcrop\fP does not currently provide options to up or downsample data to
different bit depths or convert data from one photometric interpretation
to another, e.g. 16 bits per sample to 8 bits per sample or RGB to grayscale.
.sp
\fBtiffcrop\fP is very loosely derived from code in \fBtiffcp\fP
with extensive modifications and additions to support the selection of input
images and regions and the exporting of them to one or more output files in
various groupings. The image manipulation routines are entirely new and
additional ones may be added in the future. It will handle tiled images with
bit depths that are not a multiple of eight that tiffcp may refuse to read.
.sp
\fBtiffcrop\fP was designed to handle large files containing many moderate sized images
with memory usage that is independent of the number of images in the file.
In order to support compression modes that are not based on individual
scanlines, e.g. JPEG, it now reads images by strip or tile rather than by
individual scanlines. In addition to the memory required by the input and
output buffers associated with \fBlibtiff\fP
one or more buffers at least as large as the largest image to be read are
required. The design favors large volume document processing uses over
scientific or graphical manipulation of large datasets as might be found
in research or remote sensing scenarios.
