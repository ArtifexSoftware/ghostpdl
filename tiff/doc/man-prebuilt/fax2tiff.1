.SH NAME
fax2tiff \- create a TIFF Class F fax file from raw fax data
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBfax2tiff\fP [ \fIoptions\fP ] [ \fB\-o\fP \fIoutput.tif\fP ] \fIinput.raw\fP
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBfax2tiff\fP creates a TIFF file containing  CCITT
Group 3 or Group 4 encoded data from one or more files containing \(dqraw\(dq
Group 3 or Group 4 encoded data (typically obtained directly from a fax modem).
By default, each row of data in the resultant TIFF
file is 1\-dimensionally encoded and
padded or truncated to 1728 pixels, as needed.
The resultant image is a set of low resolution (98 lines/inch)
or medium resolution (196 lines/inch)
pages, each of which is a single strip of data.
The generated file conforms to the TIFF
Class F (FAX) specification for storing facsimile data.
This means, in particular, that each page of the data does
\fBnot\fP include the trailing
\fI\(dqreturn to control\(dq\fP (\fBRTC\fP) code; as required
for transmission by the CCITT Group 3 specifications.
The old, \(dqclassic\(dq, format is created if the
\fI\%\-c\fP option is used.
(The Class F format can also be requested with the
\fI\%\-f\fP option.)
.sp
The default name of the output image is \fBfax.tif\fP;
this can be changed with the \fI\%\-o\fP option.
Each input file is assumed to be a separate page of facsimile data
from the same document.
The order in which input files are specified on the command
line is the order in which the resultant pages appear in the
output file.
.SH OPTIONS

Assume input data is EOL\-aligned. This option has effect with Group 3
encoded input only.
.UNINDENT

.TP
.B \-M
Treat input data as having bits filled from most significant bit (\fBMSB\fP) to most least bit (\fBLSB\fP).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-L
Treat input data as having bits filled from least significant bit (\fBLSB\fP) to most significant bit
(\fBMSB\fP) (default).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-B
Assume input data was encoded with black as 0 and white as 1.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-W
Assume input data was encoded with black as 1 and white as 0 (default).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-R
Specify the vertical resolution, in lines/inch, of the input images.
By default input are assumed to have a vertical resolution of 196 lines/inch.
If images are low resolution facsimile, a value of 98 lines/inch should
be specified.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-X
Specify the width, in pixels, of the input images.
By default input are assumed to have a width of 1728 pixels.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Options that affect the output file format are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-o
Specify the name of the output file.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-7
Force output to be compressed with the CCITT
Group 3 Huffman encoding algorithm (default).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-8
Force output to be compressed with the CCITT
Group 4 Huffman encoding.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-u
Force output to be uncompressed (Group 3 or Group 4).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-5
Force output to be encoded with the 1\-dimensional version of the CCITT
Group 3 Huffman encoding algorithm.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-6
Force output to be encoded with the 2\-dimensional version of the CCITT
Group 3 Huffman encoding algorithm (default).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-a
Force the last bit of each \fI\(dqEnd Of Line\(dq\fP (\fBEOL\fP)
code to land on a byte boundary (default). This \(dqzero padding\(dq will
be reflected in the contents of the \fBGroup3Options\fP
tag of the resultant TIFF file. This option has effect with Group 3 encoded output only.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-p
Do not EOL\-align output. This option has effect with Group 3 encoded
output only.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c
Generate \(dqclassic\(dq Group 3 TIFF format.
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-f

attempts to set the rows/strip
that no more than 8 kilobytes of data appear in a strip (with except of G3/G4
compression schemes). If you specify special value \fB\-1\fP
it will results in infinite number of the rows per strip. The entire image

compression schemes.
