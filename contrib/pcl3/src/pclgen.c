  In the implementation of these and other functions I have mainly used the
  following documents:

  - Hewlett-Packard
    "Technical Reference Guide for the HP DeskJet 500 Series Printers"
    First edition, October 1994
    Manual Part Number: C2170-90099
    (Quoted as "TRG500")
  - Hewlett-Packard
    "Hewlett-Packard 300 and 400 Series DeskJet Printers - Software Developer's
      Guide"
    January 1996
    (Quoted as "DJ3/4")
  - Hewlett-Packard
    "HP DeskJet 600/800 Series Printers - Software Developer's PCL Guide"
    Fifth edition, October 1997
    (Quoted as "DJ6/8")
  - Hewlett-Packard
    "DeskJet 1120C Printer - Software Developer's PCL Guide"
    First printing, December 1997. Version 1.0.
    (Quoted as "DJ1120C")
  - Hewlett-Packard
    "Printer Job Language Technical Reference Manual"
    Edition 10, October 1997. HP Part No. 5021-0380.
    (Quoted as "PJLTRM")
  - Lexmark
    "Printer Technical Reference, Version 1.1"
    First edition, February 1999
    (Quoted as "Lexmark-PTR". It deals with PCL 5 and PCL 6.)

  In addition, some other documents are quoted in a form like "BPD02926". These
  were obtained from http://www.hp.com, usually from the directory
  cposupport/printers/support_doc. BPD02926, for example, (a short description
  of PCL commands for series-800 DeskJets) could be found as the file
  bpd02926.html in that directory.

  The routine will configure the printer such that the top left corner of the
  logical page is the top left corner of the printable area in raster space.

        across a statement like "a separate seed row is maintained for each
        graphic plane" (DJ6/8 p. 57). I've also never found a statement what
        the seed row/plane/whatever for a bitplane in a strip group with

        I therefore have to make a few assumptions. The following seem sensible:
        - The PCL interpreter maintains independent "seed lines" for each
          colorant. Each line consists of independent seed planes, one for each
          bit plane in a pixel line for that colorant (i.e., there are
          pcl3_levels_to_planes(levels) seed planes for a colorant accepting
          'levels' intensity levels).
        - If the current compression method (this is a global property of the
          interpreter) is a differential one, a bit plane is interpreted as a
          delta plane with respect to the corresponding bit plane in the
          current colorant's preceding line.
