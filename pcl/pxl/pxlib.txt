This document describes the additions to Artifex's PostScript-oriented
graphics library that were required to handle the full PCL graphics model.

	    Graphics model extensions from PostScript to PCL

Introduction
============

The PCL XL graphics model is very close to the PostScript model, but it is
not identical, and it includes several features that are difficult or
impossible to emulate using the PostScript concepts.  This document presents
the additions we made to our PostScript-oriented graphics library in order
to implement the full PCL XL graphics model.  We have noted the places where
we did this only for efficiency, and where we saw no alternative.

PCL5 (including HP-GL/2) also requires a very small number of additions
beyond PCL XL.  We have included these in this document as well.

Changes in a given revision of this document are marked with the revision

Both PCL5 and PCL XL
====================

RasterOp and transparency
-------------------------

All drawing operations must be capable of incorporating an arbitrary 3-input
Boolean operation (RasterOp).  With the RasterOp extension, imaging
operations compute a function D = F(D,S,T), where F is an arbitrary 3-input
Boolean function, D is the destination (frame buffer or print buffer), S is
the source (described below), and T is the texture (always the current
PostScript color, which may be a pattern).  The source and texture depend on
the PostScript imaging operation:

	- For fill and stroke, the source is solid black, covering the
	region to be painted.

	- For *show and imagemask, the source is solid black, covering the
	pixels to be painted.

	- For image and colorimage, the source is the image data.

On black-and-white devices, D, S, and T are considered to be 1-bit values in
RGB space; this require modifying F if the device actually uses 0 = white, 1
= black.  (Our library handles this automatically.)  On such devices, F is
applied directly to the rendered bits, i.e. after transfer function and
halftoning.  On color (even non-contone) or gray-scale devices, D, S, and T
are considered to be N-bit RGB values, and F is applied before any color
realization.

The source and destination each also have a "transparent" flag: if the
corresponding flag is set, then white pixels in the source or destination
respectively suppress writing into the frame buffer, regardless of what F
may othewise compute.  For black-and-white devices, transparency can be
implemented by modifying F; for gray-scale or color devices, an explicit
additional test is required.

We see no reasonable way for clients to implement RasterOp, or transparency
on non-black-and-white devices.

Triangular caps
---------------

PCL supports triangular caps.  If the square cap looks like this:

	________
	|      |
	|      |
	|      |

then the triangular cap looks like this:

	  /  \
	/      \
	|      |

i.e. its lines meet the ends of the stroke at 135 degrees, and each other at
90 degrees.

If the library provides a way for clients to get the result of applying the
current dash pattern to a path (similar in spirit to flattenpath), clients
could in principle implement triangular caps.

Null joins
----------

PCL supports a join style called null joins, in which a pair of caps is used
instead of a join.  I.e., with null joins, each line, curve, or arc is
considered to be a separate subpath.  Null join style does not affect the
junctures between the line segments produced by flattening curves or arcs:
these are always "smooth".  (When null joins are selected, our library uses
bevel joins between curve and arc segments.)

While in principle clients could implement null joins, it would require
extra work because it is the join style in effect at path painting time, not
at path construction time, that determines the output; thus the client
cannot use the obvious approach of breaking the path up as it is being
constructed.  Instead, the client must record the sequence of path drawing
operations and replay them in modified form if the join style at painting
time is different from the join style at construction time.

Dots
----

When a dash pattern includes zero-length drawn segments, PostScript
interpreters produce a dot if round caps are in effect, and nothing
otherwise.  H-P's PCL XL interpreters, however, always draw a pair of caps
(including a hairline for butt caps); something similar happens in PCL5.

We thought clients could implement this by replacing zero-length drawn
elements of the dash pattern with tiny nearly-zero-length elements.
However, this doesn't work:

	- If the tiny element shortens the following skipped distance, then
no dot will get drawn at the very end of a line that is an exact multiple of
the pattern length.

	- If the tiny element shortens the previous skipped distance (or a
final skip if it is the first element of the pattern), the entire pattern
will be displaced slightly, leading to other problems at points that exactly
line up with the boundaries of pattern elements.

	- If the tiny element shortens both the previous and following
distance, then if it falls exactly on a corner, the caps will not be at 180
degrees to each other, leading to visual anomalies.

We verified through experimentation that all these problems do occur with a
client-side implementation, and that they do not occur in H-P's printers.
We still suspect there is a way for clients to implement this behavior,
especially if the library can deliver the dash expansion as noted for
triangular caps above.

Accurate curves
---------------

The curve flattening method implied by the PostScript Language Reference
Manual always uses chords to approximate curves.  As a result, the last
chord is not quite a segment of the tangent, and so a butt or square cap is
not quite perpendicular to the tangent.  In PostScript, this is usually not
a problem, because line joining takes care of filling the small wedge-shaped
gap that would otherwise occur between the end of an arc and an adjacent
line continuing in the same direction.  However, with null joins, the wedge
becomes visible.  Also, with a wide brush, the discrepancy from horizontal
or vertical at the ends of semicircles becomes visually noticeable.  Our
library provides a flag that creates a very short tangent segment as the
first and last line of a flattened curve, thereby avoiding this problem.

In principle, clients could create accurate curve ends by adding the short
tangent lines explicitly (and adjusting the end parameters of the curve
appropriately), but it would be quite a nuisance.

Character bolding
-----------------

PCL supports pseudo-bolding for characters.  This is defined as "smearing"
the filled region to the right and upward before imaging it onto the page.
In particular, smearing happens before RasterOp.

We don't implement this directly in our graphics library; however, our PCL
interpreters implement it in the callback for rendering characters that are
not yet in the cache.  A client could implement it by asking for the bitmap
of the character and then doing the smearing, but this would prevent the
smeared character from being cached.  (This may not be important in
practice.)

PCL5 only
=========

Triangular joins
----------------

PCL5 supports triangular joins.  The triangular "spike" is the reflection of
filling the outside "notch" where the lines meet.  The spike is not affected
by the miter limit.

As with triangular caps, clients could implement triangular joins (with a
bit of trouble) if the library did the dash pattern expansion first.

PCL XL only
===========

Negative dash pattern elements
------------------------------

PCL XL allows negative lengths in dash patterns.  What this appears to mean
is that a negative segment is drawn backwards from the current point at the
time it is encountered, with no caps (or perhaps the caps are reflected 180
degrees so they are actually inside the segment -- we didn't experiment with
segments short enough to test this), and also skips over an equal amount of
following positive pattern elements.  What seems bizarre to us is that the
negative segment is not drawn back along the line: it is drawn in a straight
line in a direction 180 degrees from the current line segment.  If this
occurs just after a corner, for example, the drawn segment sticks out in a
direction far off the actual path.

Our PCL XL interpreter currently handles negative lengths in the client, by
transforming the pattern, but the results are not correct if the line is
shorter than one full pattern repetition or if the line has sharp corners.
Clients could handle the former if dash patterns were generalized so that
instead of an offset, they had a separate initial part, i.e., if they could
be of the form A B C D E D E D E...; but we don't see how clients could
handle the odd H-P interpretation of the latter.  (We doubt that it needs to
be handled in practice.)

Dual halftones
--------------

By default, source and texture (i.e., colors/patterns and images) use
slightly different halftones.  We think they are the same halftone with
slightly different phase, but we aren't sure of this yet.  This is required
in order to produce certain subtle (but highly visible) interaction effects
when combining halftoned source and texture with RasterOp.

We don't see any way for clients to implement dual halftones when RasterOp
is involved, because not all 3-input Boolean functions can be handled by
performing two 2-input operations with a change of halftone in between.
