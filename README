jbig2dec is a decoder library and example utility implementing the JBIG2 bi-level image
compression spec. Also known as ITU T.88 and ISO IEC 14492, and now included by reference in
Adobe's PDF 1.4.

The basic invocation is:

	jbig2dec [-o <output file>] file.jbig2

It also supports separate 'global' and 'page' streams, generally extracted from some embedded
format:
	jbig2dec [-o <output file>] <global_stream> <page_stream>

The program is only partially functional at this time, but should be useful in some limited
contexts. We welcome files that the decoder can't handle, or renders incorrectly.

A set of example files is available from http://www.ece.ubc.ca/spmg/jbig2/bitstreams/main.html
