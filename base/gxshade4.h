#define USE_LINEAR_COLOR_PROCS 1 /* Old code = 0, new code = 1. */

#define QUADRANGLES 0 /* 0 = decompose by triangles, 1 = by quadrangles. */
/* The code QUADRANGLES 1 appears unuseful.
   We keep it because it stores a valuable code for constant_color_quadrangle,
   which decomposes a random quadrangle into 3 or 4 trapezoids.
   The color approximation looks worse than with triangles, and works some slower.
 */
#define INTERPATCH_PADDING (fixed_1 / 2) /* Emulate a trapping for poorly designed documents. */
/* When INTERPATCH_PADDING > 0, it generates paddings between patches,
   i.e. performs a patch expansion, being similar
   to the path adjustment in the filling algorithm.
   The expansion is an emulation of Adobe's trapping.
   The value specifies the width of paddings.
   We did some testing of Adobe RIP, and it looks as applying
   same logicks as for clipping - any part of pixel inside.
   Therefore the expansion should be half pixel size.
 */
#define COLOR_CONTIGUITY 1 /* A smothness divisor for triangulation. */
/* This is a coefficient used to rich
   a better color contiguity. The value 1 corresponds to PLRM,
   bigger values mean more contiguity. The speed decreases as
   a square of COLOR_CONTIGUITY.
 */
#define LAZY_WEDGES 1 /* 0 = fill immediately, 1 = fill lazy. */
/* This mode delays creating wedges for a boundary until
   both neoghbour areas are painted. At that moment we can know
   all subdivision points for both right and left areas,
   and skip wedges for common points. Therefore the number of wadges
   dramatically reduces, causing a significant speedup.
   The LAZY_WEDGES 0 mode was not systematically tested.
