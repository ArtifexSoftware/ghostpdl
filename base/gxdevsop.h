/* Definitions for device specific operations */

/* This file enumerates a series of device specific operations, that can be
 * performed using the 'dev_spec_op' procedure in the gs_device structure.
 *
 * This scheme, as its name suggests, allows clients to make device specific
 * calls to any given device in a safe way. This is to gs_devices what an
 * ioctl is to unix file handles.
 *
 * Design features of this scheme ensure that:
 *  * Devices that support a given call can efficiently implement both
 *    input and output.
 *  * Devices that do not support a given call can efficiently refuse it
 *    (without having to know all the possible calls).
 *  * Devices that are built upon lower level devices can trivially either:
 *     + forward (possibly unknown) calls onto those sub devices
 *     + override known calls locally without passing them on
 *     + pass on known calls, and then modify their returned values.
 *  * New devices can add new device specific operations without requiring
 *    any changes to existing devices using the scheme.
 *
 * Traditionally, when developing Ghostscript, to add new device operations
 * we'd have extended the list of device procedures to include one (or more)
 * new entrypoint(s). With the dev_spec_op entrypoint in place, we have the
 * choice whether to do this or not.
 *
 * Calls which need to be supported by all (or most) devices may well result
 * in the extension of the device proc table as usual. Calls which only need
 * affect a relatively small number of devices may well result in the use
 * of a dev_spec_op call. The two schemes are complementary and which one is
 * most appropriate for any given extension will vary according to the
 * judgement of the programmer.
 *
 * All device_specific_operations are identified by a unique dev_spec_op
 * key, listed in the enumeration below. To add a new one, simply extend the
 * enumeration.
 *
 * The generic call to a dev_spec_op function is as follows:
 *
 * int dev_spec_op(gx_device *dev, int dev_spec_op, void *data, int size);
 *
 * As is common with most of ghostscript, a return value < 0 indicates an
 * error. In particular a return value of gs_error_undefined will be taken
 * to mean that a device did not support the given dev_spec_op. A return
 * value >= 0 indicates that the device operation completed successfully.
 * In general devices should use 0 to indicate successful completion, but
 * for some calls values > 0 may be used to indicate dev_spec_op specific
 * completion values.
 *
 * While this scheme is designed to be general and extensible, there are
 * some common use cases. Where possible, for consistency, implementers
 * should follow the example set by these existing 'families' of calls.
 *
 * Querying device characteristics (or 'Does this device support an
 * operation?')
 *
 *    Called with: data = NULL, size = 0.
 *    Returns: < 0 for 'does not support', > 0 for supports.
 *    Examples:
 *      gxdso_pattern_can_accum    (Does the device support pattern
 *                                  accumulation?)
 *      gxdso_planar_native        (Is the device natively planar?)
 *
 * Generic device function call:
 *
 *   Called with data -> structure full of arguments, size = sizeof that
 *   structure.
 *   Returns: usual gs_error conventions
 *   Examples:
 *     gxdso_foo                    (An example)
 *         data -> struct { int  x;
 *                          y_t *y;
 *                          z_t *z; }
 *         size = sizeof(*data);
 *     gxdso_bar                    (An example)
 *         data -> variable sized buffer of bytes to process
 *         size = sizeof(*data); (number of bytes in the buffer)
 *
 * Generic device function call (short form):
 *
 *   Where we have a limited number of arguments, we can avoid the overhead
 *   of creating a structure on the stack just to pass them.
 *   Returns: usual gs_error conventions
 *   Examples:
 *     gxdso_pattern_start_accum   (Start pattern accumulation)
 *         data = (void *)(gs_pattern1_instance_t *)pinst;
 *         size = (int)(gx_bitmap_is)id;
 *     gxdso_pattern_load     (Load a pattern)
 *         data  = NULL;
 *         size = (int)(gx_bitmap_id)id;
