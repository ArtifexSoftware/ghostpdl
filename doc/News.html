<h3><a name="10.02.0_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h3>
<h4>Included below are incompatible changes from recent releases (the
specific release in question is listed in parentheses). We include these,
for now, as we are aware that not everyone upgrades with every release.</h4>
<ul>
</ul>
<h3><a name="10.02.0_changelog"></a>Changelog</h3>
<p>From 9.55.0 onwards, in recognition of how unwieldy very large HTML files can become
(History9.html had reached 8.1Mb!), we intend to only include the summary highlights (above).
<p>For anyone wanting the full details of the changes in
a release, we ask them to look at the history in our public git repository:
<a href="https://git.ghostscript.com/?p=ghostpdl.git;a=shortlog;h=refs/tags/ghostpdl-10.00.0">ghostpdl-10.00.0</a> log.
<p>If this change does not draw negative feedback, History?.htm file(s) will be removed from the release archives.
