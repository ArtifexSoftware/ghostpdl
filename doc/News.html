<h2><a name="Version10.05.0"></a>Version 10.05.0 (2025-03-12)</h2>
<p> Highlights in this release include:
<ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>This release addresses CVEs: CVE-2025-27835, CVE-2025-27832, CVE-2025-27831, CVE-2025-27836, CVE-2025-27830, CVE-2025-27833, CVE-2025-27837, CVE-2025-27834
<p>In addition one other security fix for which a CVE is pending which will be added to the online version of this document when assigned:
<a href="https://ghostscript.readthedocs.io/en/gs10.05.0/News.html">News</a>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 10.05.0 release deprecates the non-standard operator &quot;selectdevice&quot;,
all code should now be using the standard &quot;setpagedevice&quot; operator. &quot;selectdevice&quot; will be removed
in the 10.06.0 release.
</li>
<li>
<p>We now support production of PDF/X-1a and PDF/X-4a in addition to the existing support for PDF/X-3
</li>
<li>
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> In the 10.04.0 release we added protection for
device selection from PostScript input. This will mean that, by default, only the device specified
on the command line will be permitted. Similar to the file permissions, there will be a &quot;--permit-devices=&quot;
allowing a comma separation list of allowed devices. This will also take a single wildcard &quot;*&quot; allowing any device.
<p>Any application which relies on allowing PostScript to change devices during a job will have to be aware, and take action
to deal with this change.
<p>The exception is &quot;nulldevice&quot;, switching to that requires no special action.
</li>
<li>
<p>Our efforts in code hygiene and maintainability continue.
</li>
<li>
<p>The usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes, and incremental improvements.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.53.0) We have added the capability to build with the Tesseract OCR engine. In such
a build, new devices are available (pdfocr8/pdfocr24/pdfocr32) which render the
output file to an image, OCR that image, and output the image "wrapped" up as a
PDF file, with the OCR generated text information included as "invisible" text
(in PDF terms, text rendering mode 3).
<p>Mainly due to time constraints, we only support including Tesseract from
source included in our release packages, and not linking to Tesseract/Leptonica
shared libraries. Whether we add this capability will be largely dependent on
community demand for the feature.
<p>See <a href="https://www.ghostscript.com/ocr.html">Enabling OCR</a> for more details.

<h3><a name="10.05.0_Incompatible_changes"></a>Incompatible changes</h3>
<h4>Included below are incompatible changes from recent releases (the
specific release in question is listed in parentheses). We include these,
for now, as we are aware that not everyone upgrades with every release.</h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(10.05.0) The 10.05.0 release deprecates the non-standard operator &quot;selectdevice&quot;,
all code should now be using the standard &quot;setpagedevice&quot; operator. &quot;selectdevice&quot; will be removed
in the 10.06.0 release.
</li>
<p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> (10.04.0) we added protection for device selection from PostScript input. This will mean that, by default,
only the device specified on the command line will be permitted. Similar to the file permissions, there will be a
&quot;--permit-devices=&quot; allowing a comma separation list of allowed devices. This will also take a single wildcard
&quot;*&quot; allowing any device.
<p>Any application which relies on allowing PostScript to change devices during a job will have to be aware, and take action
to deal with this change.
<p>The exception is &quot;nulldevice&quot;, switching to that requires no special action.
</li>
<li>
<p>(10.03.1) Almost all the &quot;internal&quot; PostScript procedures defined
during the interpreter startup are now &quot;executeonly&quot;, further reducing
the attack surface of the interpreter.
<p>The nature of these procedures means there should be no impact for legitimate
usage, but it is possible it will impact uses which abuse the previous accessibility
(even for legitimate reasons). Such cases may now require &quot;DELAYBIND&quot;,
See <a href="https://ghostscript.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Use.html#ddelaybind">DELAYBIND</a>
</li>
<li>
<p>(10.03.1) The &quot;makeimagedevice&quot; non-standard operator has been removed. It allowed
low level access to the graphics library in a way that was, essentially impossible to secure.
</li>
<li>
<p>(10.03.1) The &quot;putdeviceprops&quot;, &quot;getdeviceprops&quot;, &quot;finddevice&quot;,
&quot;copydevice&quot;, &quot;findprotodevice&quot; non-standard operators have all been removed.
They provided functionality that is either accessible through standard operators, or should not
be used by user PostScript.
</li>
<li>
<p>(10.03.1) The process of &quot;tidying&quot; the PostScript namespace should have removed
only non-standard and undocumented operators. Nevertheless, it is possible that
any integrations or utilities that rely on those non-standard and undocumented
operators may stop working or may change behaviour.
<p>If you encounter such a case, please contact us (<a href="https://discord.gg/H9GXKwyPvY">Discord<a>,
<a href="https://web.libera.chat/#ghostscript">#ghostscript IRC channel</a>,
or the gs-devel mailing list would be best), and we'll work with you to either find an
alternative solution or return the previous functionality, if there is genuinely no other
option.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.55.0) Changes to the <code>device API</code>. This will affect developers and maintainers of
Ghostscript devices. Firstly, and most importantly, the way device-specific "procs" are specified has
been rewritten to make it (we think!) clearer and less confusing. See
<a href="https://ghostscript.readthedocs.io/Drivers.htm">The Interface between Ghostscript and Device Drivers</a> and
<a href="https://www.notion.so/artifexsoftware/The-Great-Device-Rework-Of-2021-94092fe1395d4a088b91462f0ca5038a">The Great Device Rework Of 2021</a>
for more details.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.55.0) The command line options <code>-sGraphicsICCProfile=___</code>, <code>-dGraphicsIntent=#</code>, <code>-dGraphicsBlackPt=#</code>,
<code>-dGraphicsKPreserve=#</code> have been changed to <code>-sVectorICCProfile=___</code>, <code>-dVectorIntent=#</code>, <code>-dVectorBlackPt=#</code>,
<code>-dVectorKPreserve=#</code>.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.53.0) As of 9.53.0, we have (re-)introduced the patch level to the version number,
this helps facilitate a revised policy on handling security-related issues.
<p><strong>Note for GSView Users: </strong>The patch level addition breaks GSView 5 (it is
hardcoded to check for versions <code>704-999</code>. It is possible, but not guaranteed that
a GSView update might be forthcoming to resolve this.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.52) <code>-dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY</code>: The transparency compositor (and related
features), whilst we are improving it, remains sensitive to being driven correctly, and
incorrect use can have unexpected/undefined results. Hence, as part of improving security,
we limited access to these operators, originally using the <code>-dSAFER</code> feature.
As we made "SAFER" the default mode, that became unacceptable, hence the new option
<code>-dALLOWPSTRANSPARENCY</code> which enables access to the operators.
</li>
<li>
<p>(9.50) There are a couple of subtle incompatibilities between the old and new SAFER
implementations. Firstly, as mentioned in the 9.50 release notes, SAFER now leaves
standard PostScript functionality unchanged (except for the file access limitations).
Secondly, the interaction with <code>save</code>&sol;<code>restore</code> operations
has changed. See <a href="https://ghostscript.readthedocs.io/Use.htm#Safer">SAFER</a>.
<p><strong>Important Note for Windows Users</strong>:
<br>
The file/path pattern matching is case-sensitive, even on Windows. This is a
change in behaviour compared to the old code which, on Windows, was case
<i>in</i>sensitive. This is in recognition of changes in Windows behaviour,
in that it now supports (although does not enforce) case sensitivity.
</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="10.05.0_changelog"></a>Changelog</h3>
<p>From 9.55.0 onwards, in recognition of how unwieldy very large HTML files can become
(History9.html had reached 8.1Mb!), we intend to only include the summary highlights (above).
<p>For anyone wanting the full details of the changes in
a release, we ask them to look at the history in our public git repository:
<a href="https://cgit.ghostscript.com/cgi-bin/cgit.cgi/ghostpdl.git/log/?h=gs10.05.0">ghostpdl-10.05.0</a> log.
<p>If this change does not draw negative feedback, History?.htm file(s) will be removed from the release archives.
