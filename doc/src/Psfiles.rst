``gs_ciddc.ps``
   Defines Decoding and ``CIDDecoding`` resource categories and related procsets. Used for for emulating PostScript fonts with non-PostScript font technologies.

``gs_cidfm.ps``
   Provides resource mapping for ``CIDFont`` category.

``gs_cidfn.ps``

``gs_dscp.ps``
   Code to compensate for badly written PostScript files by setting ``Orientation`` according to the DSC comments.

``gs_epsf.ps``
   Allow the interpreter to recognize DOS EPSF file headers, and skip to the PostScript section of the file.

``gs_fapi.ps``
   :ref:`Font API<Fonts FAPI>` support.

``gs_fonts.ps``
   ``gs_init.ps`` reads this in. It initializes Ghostscript's font machinery and provides some utility procedures that work with fonts.

``gs_frsd.ps``
   Support for the PostScript LanguageLevel 3 ``ReusableStreamDecode`` filter.

``gs_img.ps``
   Implementation of the traditional (non-dictionary) form of the image and imagemask operators, and the colorimage operator (including the Next alphaimage facility).

``gs_init.ps``
   Ghostscript reads this automatically when it starts up. It contains definitions of many standard procedures and initialization for a wide variety of things.

``gs_lev2.ps``
   ``gs_init.ps`` reads this in if the Ghostscript interpreter includes Level 2 PostScript functions. It contains definitions of procedures and miscellaneous initialization for the Level 2 functions.

   Initialize PostScript LanguageLevel 3 functions.

``gs_resmp.ps``
   A ``procset`` for redefining resource categories with a resource map.

   ``gs_init.ps`` reads this in if the Level 2 resource machinery is included. Currently, this is the case for all Level 2 configurations.

``gs_setpd.ps``
   Implementation of the ``setpagedevice`` operator.

``gs_type1.ps``
   ``gs_init.ps`` reads this in if the Ghostscript interpreter includes Type 1 font capability (which it normally does).




Configuration files
------------------------

These files are found in the ``Resource/Init`` subdirectory of the Ghostscript source distribution. Users are allowed to modify them to configure Ghostscript.

``Fontmap``
   Font mapping table.

``cidfmap``
   CID font mapping table. Allows substitution of a CID font for another CID font or a TrueType font for a CID font.

``FAPIconfig``
   A configuration file for Font API client.

``FAPIfontmap``
   Font mapping table for Font-API-handled fonts.

``FAPIcidfmap``
   Font mapping table for Font-API-handled CID fonts.



More obscure system files
------------------------------------------------

Unless otherwise stated, these files are found in the ``Resource/Init`` subdirectory of the Ghostscript source distribution.

``gs_agl.ps``
   Contains the mapping from Adobe glyph names to Unicode values, used to support TrueType fonts and disk-based Type 1 fonts.

``gs_cet.ps``
   Sets a number of alternate defaults to make Ghostscript behave more like Adobe CPSI. Useful for running the CET conformance test suite.

``gs_diskn.ps``
   This file implements the ``%disk IODevice`` (``diskn.dev`` feature). See the :ref:`language documentation<Language.html>` for information on the use of the ``%disk#`` devices. These PostScript modifications primarily perform the searching of all ``Searchable`` file systems in a defined ``SearchOrder`` when a file reference does not contain an explicit ``%device%`` specifier (such as ``%os%`` or ``%disk0%``). This is required to emulate undocumented behaviour of Adobe PostScript printers that have a disk and was experimentally determined.

``gs_kanji.ps``
   This file provides support for the Wadalab free Kanji font. It is not included automatically in any configuration. This file is stored in the ``lib`` subdirectory.

``gs_pdfwr.ps``
   This file contains some patches for providing information to the :title:`pdfwrite` driver. It is included only if the :title:`pdfwrite` driver is included.

``ht_ccsto.ps``
   A default stochastic CMYK halftone. This file is in the public domain. This file is stored in the ``lib`` subdirectory.

``stcolor.ps``
   Configure the (Epson) :title:`stcolor` driver. This file is stored in the ``lib`` subdirectory.


PDF-specific system files
------------------------------------------------

These files are found in the ``Resource/Init`` subdirectory of the Ghostscript source distribution.

``pdf_rbld.ps``
   Contains procedures for bebuilding damaged PDF files.

``pdf_sec.ps``
   PDF security (encryption) code.

   Support for ICC color profiles. These are not a standard PostScript feature, but are used in the PDF interpreter, as ICC profiles may be embedded in PDF files.


These files are found in the lib subdirectory of the Ghostscript source distribution. These files are templates and should not be used without modification.

``PDFX_def.ps``
   This is a sample prefix file for creating a PDF/X document with the :title:`pdfwrite` device.

   This is a sample prefix file for creating a PDF/A document with the :title:`pdfwrite` device.



Display PostScript-specific system files
------------------------------------------------

These files are found in the ``Resource/Init`` subdirectory of the Ghostscript source distribution.

   A gray-scale picture of a stylishly dressed woman swinging a golf club.

``grayalph.ps``
   Grayscaled text test pattern.
