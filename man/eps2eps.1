ps2ps, eps2eps \- Ghostscript PostScript "distiller"
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBps2ps\fR [ \fIoptions\fR ] \fIinput.ps output.ps\fR
.br
\fBeps2eps\fR [ \fIoptions\fR ] \fIinput.eps output.eps\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBps2ps\fR uses \fIgs\fR(1) to convert \fBPostScript\fR(tm) file
"input.ps" to simpler and (usually) faster PostScript in
"output.ps".  Normally the output is allowed to use PostScript Level 2
constructs, but the \fB\-dLanguageLevel=1\fR option restricts the output to
Level 1.
.PP
\fBeps2eps\fR performs the equivalent optimization for Encapsulated
PostScript (EPS) files.
