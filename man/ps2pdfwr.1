.TH PS2PDFWR 1 "27 September 2021" 9.55.0 Ghostscript \" -*- nroff -*-
.SH NAME
ps2pdfwr \- Convert PostScript to PDF without specifying CompatibilityLevel, using ghostscript
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBps2pdfwr\fR  [options...] {input.[e]ps|-} [output.pdf|-]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This wrapper script invokes
.BR gs (1)
with following arguments

.ce
.B -q -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite

as well as the appropriate
.B -dOutputFile
argument, all preceded and followed by any command-line arguments. Finally, the security option
.B -dSAFER
is prepended before all the other options (This is now redundant as "SAFER" is now the default,
but the option does no harm).

The version-specific
.B ps2pdf
scripts all invoke this one with the addition of the respective compatibility level option.
