<pre>
Change Windows makefiles extensively for 64-bit issues:
1. Command line nmake works now for 32-bit build on 64-bit OS
2. 64-bit builds use different directories for objects to allow 32 and
   64 bit builds to be alternated without confusion. 64-bit objects have
   '64' suffix to the 32-bit objects which remain in the same places
3. 64-bit binaries are now named uniquely, e.g. gsdll64.dll and gswin64.exe
   Binaries coexist in 'bin' directory since names are unique.
4. 'Style' changes to the makefiles to remove the '32' suffix from files
   that are not 32-bit specific -- hopefully will prevent future confusion.

Tested with VS 2005 and VS 2008 as well as with GhostPDL.sln (to make sure
the pcl, xps, and language_switch builds don't break.

Fix (ps2write) : Enable ps2write on PCL

Bug #691881 &quot;ps2write broken with GhostPCL&quot;

ps2write formerly required 4 'resource' PostScript files stored on disk in order to
write a PostScript header to the output file. These files have now been converted into
'C' header files and included in the source in earlier revisions.

This commit removes the last barrier to ps2write working with PCL (and other
non-PostScript languages) by removing a disk-based check for opdfread.ps.

<pre>
A set of changes to make it easier to use the UFST with Ghostscript
and to get us closer to having the option of the UFST handling font
types other than the Microtype fonts.

The UFST build, using the default COMPILE_INITS=1  will now include
the Microtype FCO files in the rom file system along with the other
initialisation files (it does not currently strip out the normal
Postscript fonts in Resource/Fonts), and setup default values for
the various paramters required to have Ghostscript use the
Microtype fonts (these can still be overridden on the command
line). For the build with COMPILE_INITS=0, the default paths
will use the path to the UFST you specify for configure, or
nmake on Windows.


Included in this revision are changes to prevent the UFST version
5.x (or less) from trying to handle non-Microtype fonts, and allow
it to safely fall back to the Freetype (or a.n.other FAPI plugin).
UFST 6.2 or better will try to handle all fonts types, but this is
not yet reliable.

Currently, this code only replaces the UFST memory management on
UFST 6.2 and above (this is purely because I haven't time to test
this capability on UFST 5 yet).

A further change will be committed shortly to the UFST 5 sources
to force the UFST to use the Ghostscript stream IO instead of the
standard lib file IO on the Windows builds (this has been in place
for the Unix/Linux UFST builds for some time).

Fix ps2write : Don't depend on the PS file system for resources.

ps2write needs up to 4 resource files which are normally stored in the PostScript ROM
file system. However on PCL and other languages these resources are (obviously) not
present, so the output is incomplete.

Move the relevant files from PostScript into 'C' as header files. Remove the files from
the PostScript file system to save ROM file system space. Put the removed files into
the gs/lib folder for safe-keeping. Add the .h files as dependencies for gdevpdfu.c in

Fix (pdfwrite) : Always write a ToUnicode CMap for TrueType fonts

Bug #691907 &quot;PDFs with TrueType fonts from Windows PostScript files not searchable&quot;

Patch from SaGS.

When choosing whether to embed a ToUnicode CMap, always embed if the font type is 
TrueType. This is because TT fonts are always embedded as symbolic, and we now no longer
add Encodings to Symbolic TT fonts (violates spec), which results in PDF files where the
text is unsearchable and cannot be successfully copy/pasted in the absence of a
ToUnicode CMap.

It is possible that the ToUnicode CMap is incorrectly generated, but this is no worse
than having no CMap at all.

No expected differences since ToUnicode CMaps are not used in rendering.

Fix (pdfwrite) : permit symbolic fonts in PDF/A output

Bug #691877 &quot;Invalid text when converting to PDF/A&quot;

TrueType fonts were being emitted as non-symbolic when PDF/A output was selected. This
was causing the text to be incorrect, because the fonts actually are symbolic and 
Acrobat was unable to apply the correct decoding.

This will result in more text being unsearchable/copyable but the rendering result is 
correct, which is more important.

While searching for performance on an ARM based dev board, I developed 2
new versions of the skip_white_pixels macro. The first uses native int sized
checking, and should be faster on long run matching. I have as yet been unable
to find any files that show this expected speedup.

The second should be faster on architectures (such as ARM) where the tradeoff
in the test is different (and where pointer arithmetic is cheaper than array
indexing).

Both versions are disabled by default until the case for their existence has
been proven, but are committed here to avoid bitrot.

More changes for CUPS, mostly to the build system.

We now build the CUPS device unconditionally on Windows, using the recently added local
partial copy of the CUPS library sources. This change also builds CUPS on Linux either
using the system shared libraries (if available) or using the same partial copy of the 
library sources, if *specifically* directed to use this.

On Windows CUPS is now always built and installed. On Unix systems the behavious is as
follows:

./configure cups not installed  - no cups device
./configure cups is installed   - cups device linked to system cups shared libraries.
./configure --disable-cups      - no cups device, regardless of cups libs installed
                                  on system
./configure --with-local-cups   - cups device with the partial cups code, regardless of
                                  cups libs installed on system
./configure --with-local-cups --disable-cups results in no cups device.

No differences expected as the cluster should still build and run with the system
CUPS libraries just as it always has.

More changes to the CUPS sources so they will compile on various systems:

language.c - if __APPLE__ is true, includes code which uses what I think is Carbon
             Framework calls and structures, but does not #include any of the .h files.
             Modified to #undef __APPLE__ to avoid this.

ppd.c  -  Same problem as for MSVC, the include file string.h seems to prevent the C
          string.h being included, and so leaves strchr undefined. Now unconditionally
          provide a prototype for strchr.

localize.c - Another problem with string.h. This doesn't exist on the MSVC build, but
             unconditionally providing a prototype fro strcmp doesn't cause an error.

The code now builds on MSVC, Linux and Mac. Lots of warnings, but I don't propose to
try and deal with those as they would require extensive alterations to the CUPS
sources.

Update the CUPS sources so that they can be compiled under Windows.

1) Remove config.h which was a Linux configure result, replace with configwin.h (from
the CUPS distribution for Windows) and configlinux.h which is config,h renamed. We
will copy and use the correct version at make time.

2) cups/debug.c guard the use of pthread_mutex so that we don't try to use it if
HAVE_PTHREAD_H is not defined, as the variable will not be declared. Guard use of 
cups_debug_filter and cups_filter with a #ifndef WIN32 as these variables are not 
defined in a Windows build. Replace gettimeofday with a Windows equivalent when 
building on Windows as this function is not available.

3) ppd.c Add a definition of strchr when building for Windows. The use of an include
file called string.h confuses MSVC and it does not include the C string.h which leaves 
strchr undefined.

4) string.h When defining equivalents to strcasecmp and strncasecmp, also define the
HAVE_* variables so that inclusion order doesn't lead to these being undefined when
we have declared equivalents.

5) image-bmp.c Guard the declaration of the BI_* constants with a #ifndef WIN32 as 
these are Windows constants and already defined on a Windows build.

6) image-colorspace.c Define cbrt() in terms of pow() when WIN32 is set as the MSVC
compiler does not define a cube root function.

7) image-tiff.c Guard inclusion of unistd.h when HAVE_LIBTIFF is true as this include
file does not ship with MSVC on Windows.


These have been supplied to the CUPS development group, and at least some of the
problems are likely resolved in a newer version of CUPS.

We want to be able to use planar buffers in a line interleaved format.
Unfortunately, at the moment the planar device is hardcoded to use

between line pointers.

This does assume that we can always safely read line_ptrs[1], even if we only

<pre>
Bug 691897 shows a PDF that is much slower when transparency is enabled than
when it is not. The time is primarily spent in the stroke filling code due
to the fact that when transparency is enabled strokes need to be rendered
all at once, rather than segment by segment. This causes the scan conversion
code to have to work much harder.

In fact, the code uses solid alpha and &quot;compatible&quot; blend mode for most
strokes, so we would be perfectly safe to use the normal mechanism. The
code attempts to recognise this case already, but was only spotting &quot;Normal&quot;
blend mode and not it's synonym &quot;Compatible&quot;. We now roll the two together.

Cluster testing shows this produces various differences; none to do with
blending, all to do with different roundings in the positions of the stroked
paths. Bug 690845 is open for this already.

the Omni driver to be built it, and bmp16 not would result

Added the source code of the CUPS libraries to the Ghostscript source
package

Like with zlib, libpng, libjpeg, ... it is now possible to
build the complete Ghostscript (including the CUPS Raster output
device) on systems where there is no CUPS library available.

Note that currently only the CUPS library source code is added, the
results of the ./configure run in the Makedefs and config.h files, and
the Makefiles are stripped to only build the libraries and nothing
else. The CUPS ./configure command line which was used to obtain
makedefs and config.h was

./configure --enable-static --without-shared --disable-dbus --without-php \
--disable-slp --disable-gssapi --disable-ldap --disable-ssl \
--disable-cdsassl --disable-gnutls --disable-openssl --disable-pam \
--disable-dnssd --disable-launchd

This way the built CUPS libraries do not need any system services or
hardware interfaces of Linux. In addition to standard libraries they
use only libz, libpng, libjpeg, and libtiff. These libraries
Ghostscript needs anyway and copies of their source code also ship
with Ghostscript.

What is still missing is the integration into the build system of
Ghostscript and also the operating-system-independent base/cups.mak
file (like base/png.mak etc.).

No changes expected in the built Ghostscript as the code is not yet
integrated in the build system.

For standard gray, RGB and CMYK devices these procedures are avoided as the CMM performs all the required mappings.  This commit will show differences in the files for the cups device as well as the psdcmyk device, which also should be using the non-optimized flow due to the use of CMYK + spot colorants, which will not be managed correctly by the CMM in general.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Write ToUnicode CMap files which Acrobat likes

Bug #691862 (and also bug #691849) &quot;Unable to copy text from the converted PDF&quot;

It seems the Adobe documentation lies (or more generously is inconsistent). The
CMap tech note (5014) says that entries are not zero padded, so values less
than 256 are emitted as single bytes, values 256-&gt;65535 are two bytes etc.
However the ToUnicode CMap tech note (5411) says:

&quot;Because a “ToUnicode” mapping file is used to covert from CIDs (which begin at
decimal 0, which is expressed as 0x0000 in hexadecimal notation) to Unicode
code points, the following “codespacerange” definition, without exception,
shall always be used: 1 begincodespacerange  &lt;0000&gt; &lt;FFFF&gt;endcodespacerange&quot;

(This is somewhat restrictive, since CIDs can exceed 2 bytes, even though
UTF-16 can't, I could forsee a need to map high CIDs to lower UTF-16 values)

Finally, the PDF Reference (1.7) says:

&quot;The CMap file must contain begincodespacerange and endcodespacerangeoperators
that are consistent with the encoding that the font uses. In particular, for a
simple font, the codespace must be one byte long.&quot;

So the PDF Reference conflicts with the tech note which it references!

In fact none of the above seems to be quite what Acrobat actually does. 

It seems that Acrobat does not care what size (in bytes) the codespacerange is,
no matter what kind of font is present. However it *does* care what size the
bfrange entries are. For simple fonts the bfrange entries must be single bytes,
for CIDFonts the bfrange entries must be two bytes. Deviation in either case
leads to files which Acrobat cannot process and either causes errors or
incorrect text when copying and pasting.

Changed the ToUnicode emission (mostly restoring revision 11170 which was removed in
revision 11795 because of bug #691849) so that we emit single byte bfrange and 
codespacerange arguments for simple (non-CID) fonts, and emit double byte, padded with
00 arguments to bfrange and codespacerange for CID fonts.

No differences expected as this only affects text search/copy in Acrobat.

Fix ps2write : Attach Encoding for symbolic TrueType fonts

The recent change to not attach Encodings to Sy,bolic TrueType fonts, as per the PDF
spec, meant that ps2write also wrote symbolic TT fonts without a /Encoding. This is not
ideal, because opdfread.ps then attaches a default StandardEncoding to the font. This
simply will not work correctly.

After some experimentation with extracting (in PostScript) the POST table from the TT
font, sense prevailed. This patch modifies the condition so that if we are producing
output for ps2write we continue to attach a /Encoding. (in this case it doesn't
matter whether we are producing DSC output, we always want the Encoding)

Initial commit of code for creating halftone screens.  This code needs additional debugging, especially in the case of edge parameters.  It will currently create threshold arrays based upon desired lpi, angle, quantization levels, and device resolution.  The method is restricted to angles that are the arctangent of rational numbers. Every attempt is made to achieve the requested lpi by using the rational angle that achieves an lpi over the requested value.  Since there is a trade off between lpi and quantization levels, the requested quantization levels are obtained through dithering of the dot cells within the supercell.  Essentially, the dots within the supercell do not all take on the same values and can grow at different rates in a visually pleasing manner.  There is still a bit of work to do still on this dithering as well as controlling the rate of growth for the dots.</pre>

More enhancement work for type 3 fonts with PCL

Previously we set the horizontal advance argument to the d1 (setcachedevice) operator to

original font.

This was required to prevent regression errors with the test suite when we altered the
type 3 font accumulation so that it made more effort to preserve the input character
code, in an attempt to improve searching.

Revision 11969 fixes a problem with cached characters which was leading to the /Widths

Fix ps2write/pdfwrite : Up date the show enumerator with the cached character width

When capturing a character bitmap on the first time it is rendered, pdfwrite and
ps2write get the width of the glyph in the cache device. This is then used to update
values in the show enumerator, and these values are used as the Widths entry for the
glyph.

When imaging an already cached character, however, the enumerator values are not updated
which can lead to garbage (uninitialised data) being written as values in the /Widths
array. This patch takes the value from the cached character 'wxy' and updates the show
enumerator 'wxy' with it. This is then used as the value for the /Widths array.

Bug #691835

Temporary work-around. It is possible to get into gsicc_init_device_profile with the 
graphics state pointer (pgs) being NULL. This happens if ps2write or pdfwrite convert
a masked image into a regular image.

Because pgs is dereferenced without checking for NULL, this causes a crash.

Its not immediately clear to me if I need to modify ps2write/pdfwrite so that this 
condition doesn't occur, but for now, if pgs is NULL we return from the routine in order
to prevent a crash.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Don't clamp rectfill to the page.

Bug #691839 &quot;Invalid EPS conversion with -dEPSCrop&quot;

Rectangular fills (and only the special case of rectangles) were being clamped to the
width/height of the device when emitted. This can cause problems when a matrix is in
force which reduces the actual co-ordinates, in this case a Pattern with a 0.25 scaling.

The clamping caused co-ordinates to be reduced, and part of the fill went missing.

The comment indicated this was to 'work-around' the limit in Acrobat of 32k on user
co-ordinates, but this is too sever a clamp to apply, also the general case path code
does not apply this limit. Altered to make the limit the 32k enforced by Acrobat.

Defer the output of the header and the opdfread.ps 'prcoset' until the output file is

Fix the PageBoundingBox comment to have two % characters instead of one.

Check for a new flag 'DSC_OPDFREAD' at the start of opdfread.ps (and write its
definition as part of the header emission in ps2write). If present this prevents the
SetupPageView routine from using setmatrix to reset the CTM to the one saved during
document setup. Because the DSC-compliant output puts save/restore around each page
we don't need to reset the matrix, and the reset prevents the output from working
properly with psnup. If the flag is not present, it is treated as false.

The output now works with GSView, psselect and psnup. The only remaining work is to
track the usage of ProcessDSC and see if we can reuse any of the comments parsed out

<pre>
pdfwrite enhancement : More work towards DSC compliance

This is a resubmission of revision 11941, with some additional changes so that it
doesn't crash with pdfwrite on Linux systems. 

We now pass around the 'type' of an object much more when writing. This is so that
we can emit &quot;%%BeginResource/%%EndResource&quot; comment pairs around the resources we write.
It is also required so that we *don't* write these comments around pages.

The code now emits %%BeginProlog, then writes the opdfread.ps procedure. It then writes
all the various resources used in the document, each with a reasonable DSC comment. Then
it writes %%EndProlog. After this come the page descriptions, each is written with a
%%Page: comment and a %%PageTrailer. Finally we write the %%Trailer, %%Pages
comment (NB we write %%Pages: (atend) in the header comments as we don't know how many
pages there will be until the end) and %%EOF.

The resources are mostly defined as being of type 'file', as most of them are not normal
PostScript resources. The DSC specification says under the %%BeginResource definition 
(file note on p72) &quot;The enclosed segment is a fragment of PostScript language code or
some other item that does not fall within the other resource categories&quot; and so this
seems the best type to use for our purposes.

The output is now minimally DSC compliant, though there are a few other comments I'd
like to add if possible. Given the way the file is created we are always going to have a
large prolog, and that will need to be copied to all the pages if they are split
individually, in order to make sure that all the required resources are present.

Technically we could follow the resource chain and write %%IncludeResource comments,
at the page level at least, but this is probably more effort than it is realistically
worth.

Still need to add some more DSC comment types, and run some extensive testing.

No differences expected currently. Minimal testing with GSView suggests that the output
so far is DSC-compliant as-is.

A change to how we get the advance width of the glyph from Freetype.

Previously, we used the data in the glyph metrics structure, which
are scaled, and the undid the scaling. This is correct method for
everything except the horizontal and vertical advance distances.

We now get the two advance distances from the glyph structure,
and tell Freetype not to scale them, this avoids the rounding
errors that occur due to Freetype's fixed point number
format. It also saves the (less significant) error when we
previously unscaled the value, and saves a couple of
fairly large double precision calculations.

This does cause a number of changes in the regression suite,
the vast majority are pixel or so differences in glyph
positions. A very few are improvements.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Hashing /Subrs didn't check all subrs.

Bug #691815 &quot;ps2pdf fails on attached ps file&quot;

The new code for hashing /Subrs, to improve font checking performance, stopped comparing
/Subrs between two fonts as soon as either font had an error getting a specific /Subr. 

However it transpires that some fonts can have a null object for a /Subr (used to skip
Subrs that do nothing), and this returns a typecheck error. This led to two fonts which
differed only in the fact that one has (and uses) more Subrs than the other being 
perceived as identical. This could lead to pdfwrite using the wrong font when 
converting type 1 into CFF fonts and cause errors.

The code now continues checking remainign /Subrs if a typecheck error occurs, and as an
additional measure also checks the number of /Subrs in each font before deciding if
they are compatible.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Work around Acrobat bug with /Encoding

Bug #691809 &quot;Regression: some PDF files produced by GhostPCL r11913 cannot be read by
Acrobat 8.2.5&quot;

Acrobat 4 &amp; 8 have a peculiar bug, if a type 3 font (may affect other font types, but
it seems unlikely) has a WinAnsiEncoding, and no /Differences, then text set in that
font is not displayed by these versions of Acrobat. This may be limited to glyphs
which consist of a bitmap only.

Forcing the emission of a /Differences array for each glyph used results in these
versions of Acrobat displaying correctly (even though the 'differences' are in fact the
standard Encodings).

This does seem to be quite definitely an Acrobat bug which we are working around, no
other PDF consumer seems to have a problem with these files.

Bug #691033 &quot;Regression: 14-01.PS fails with pdfwrite&quot;

The first time a type 3 glyphis  encountered we start a charproc accumulatiopn and
exit to run the BuildChar/BuildGlyph. On return to the text processing, if the 
operation was a charpath, this would take precedence over closing the accumulator which
would lead to significant later problems.

Modified the code path to allow for the charproc accumulation to finish and if this is 
a charpath operation to rerun the operation using the newly captured glyph program.

Note this can only occur if the first operation on a given glyph in a type 3 font is 
for a charpath.

Fix (pdfwrite) : pointers not marked for garbage collection

Bug #691779 &quot;SegFault with pdfwrite and more than one cid font&quot;

pdfwrite does lazy creation of Identity ToUnicode CMaps for inclusion in output PDF
files (2 CMaps, one for horizontal and one for vertical writing). These pointers were
not marked for the garabge collector, but were stored directly in the pdf device
structure.

The CMaps were assigned to a pdfont resource type, where the pointer to the CMap *was*
marked for the garbage collector. This meant that if the pdfont resource was moved as
a result of garbage collection, the CMap could be moved as well. This left a dangling
pointer in the device structure. 

If another font resource required an identity CMap then the now garbage pointer from
the device structure would be assigned. If the new font resource was moved as a result
of garbage collection, then the attempt to relocate the CMap would fail and cause a
crash.

Fixed by marking the pointers in the device structure for the garbage collector.

No differences expected.

The bitmap mask clip device has a long standing bug when attempting to clip
a bitmap through a 1bpp bitmap (gxclipm.c, clip_runs_enumerate, line 283ish).

The code detects runs of 'on' pixels in the mask. It then keeps the last run
it found in a 1 place buffer (called 'previous'). This therefore represents
the previous run found. Whenever we find a new run, we check to see if we can
add it to the previous run to try to form a larger (vertical) rectangle. If
we can't, we should write the previous rectangle out and remember the current
one.

Unfortunately the code was writing the current rectangle out, rather than the
previous one. This has the effect of losing the first run on most lines out.

Fix so that we handle the \B command properly when we have transparency.  The stroke should be drawn in a knock-out fashion rather than blended with the fill.  This was achieved by adding in the push of a knockout transparency group for the stroke operation.  The opacity for that group had to be 1 rather than what ever the current graphic state was (otherwise you end up with the opacity applied twice).  That change revealed an issue in the clist when a transparency group is pushed where the opacity for the pdf14 clist device was being altered without having the information passed into the clist.  Fixing that required a few changes to make sure that the blend parameter changes for the transparency group end up written in the same bands as the group push rather than all bands like the normal blend parameter change compositor action does.  A few changes were needed in the clist compositor writing code to make sure that this special blend parameter change did not push a new cropping item on the cropping stack.  This commit results in a lot of progressions.  However, the cluster push revealed a couple files fts_06_0608.pdf.pdf.ppmraw for example, which may have an issue.

pdfwrite enhancement : attempt to make PCL bitmap fonts into searchable type 3

In general pdfwrite only resorts to making a bitmap from a font when it cannot handle
the original font type, which is rare for PostScript, PDF and XPS. However all PCL
bitmap fonts are handled this way.

When this happens, the bitmap is stored into a general type 3 font, a 'bucket' where all
such glyphs are stored. When this font is full, a new one is started and so on. The text
stored in the PDF page stream references the correct type 3 font, but usually the
character code will be unrelated to the original character code.

For PCL bitmap fonts pdfwrite actually starts by creating a type 3 font to hold the 
PCL bitmaps, but doesn't use it. This patch tries to store the bitmaps in the type
3 font where possible, using the character code from the original PCL document. 
Although this will not create searchable text in the general case, it does seem that
there are a good number of PCL documents which do use an ASCII encoding and so will
produce a searchable PDF file.

There are several caveats:

1) This only works at all with cached glyphs. Glyphs which are too big to fit in the
cache are instead rendered as images, not text at all. The cache has a compiled limit
of 2500 for the height of the bitmap, but this needs to take the resolution which is
being used for rendering into account. The default resolution for pdfwrite is 720 dpi
which means that bitmaps larger than ~125 rows will not be cached. (see below for more)

2) Certain kinds of text operations can't be handled at all; any case where a character
code does, or may, exceed 256 cannot be handled. These cases are handled as before by
placing in a special font with a unique character code and called from there.

3) If the font matrix is not the identity we cannot handle the glyphs, as the bitmaps
stored in the cache already include any transformations present in the Fontmatrix and
we can't undo those transformations to the bitmap. In practice this means that if the
canvas orientation (not the media) is not portrait, then this will cause the text to
be non-searchable.

4) The Acrobat searching algorithm does not work very well with this kind of text. In
our case each glyph is individually positioned on the page rather than being written
as a continuous stream of characters. Acrobat seems unable to find more than about
three glyphs in succession this way.


There is no further scope for improvement in pdfwrite as far as I can see. The only 
way to handle this better would be to make changes in the PCL interpreter so that the
bitmap PCL font is created as an actual font (probably a TrueType). This would mean that
the text would be stored in the PDF file as real text, the FontMatrix would not be a
problem, caching would not be an issue. This is probably a large project, but I suspect
less of a pain than this enhancement was.

Caching
========
In gsfont.c is a #define:
#define blimit_LARGE 2500	/* blimit/upper - max size of a single cached char */

Increasing this will allow larger glyphe to be cached. There is another limit in 
gxchar.c:
static const uint MAX_TEMP_BITMAP_BITS = 80000;

This should not be altered. Care should be exercised if increasing the maximum size 
of cached characters as these are emitted in the PDF file as inline images in a type
3 font. The PDF spec recommends that inline images should not exceed 4Kb and some 
consumers may not be able to cope with images which exceed this limit.

Because of the way that PCL draws bitmap fonts directly to the cache there is no 
possibility of making uncached glyphs work properly. Also the code for cached glyphs is
much too forgiving and attempts to add glyphs which cannot be handled. Finally there is 
no provision for type 3 fonts with non-identity matrices. Because the bitmaps in the
cache already have the scaling/rotation/shearing and clipping applied, we cannot have
a type 3 font with a non-identity matrix.

The code will be revised and recommitted.

When merging profiles, littleCMS will often do an optimization where it approximates 1-D LUTs with an exponent operation for use during merging and interpolation of the profile structures.

In general pdfwrite only resorts to making a bitmap from a font when it cannot handle
the original font type, which is rare for PostScript, PDF and XPS. However all PCL
bitmap fonts are handled this way.

When this happens, the bitmap is stored into a general type 3 font, a 'bucket' where all
such glyphs are stored. When this font is full, a new one is started and so on. The text
stored in the PDF page stream references the correct type 3 font, but usually the
character code will be unrelated to the original character code.

For PCL bitmap fonts pdfwrite actually starts by creating a type 3 font to hold the 
PCL bitmaps, but doesn't use it. This patch tries to store the bitmaps in the type
3 font where possible, using the character code from the original PCL document. 
Although this will not create searchable text in the general case, it does seem that
there are a good number of PCL documents which do use an ASCII encoding and so will
produce a searchable PDF file.

There are 3 parts to this enhancement:

1) Cached glyphs. When the current font is a type 3 font, and the text operation is
one which might result in an ASCII character code, and we can manufacture a glyph name
for the resulting character code, store the glyph in the type 3 font (rather than the
general 'bucket' font), using the character code and glyph name. Glyphs which can't
be handled this way for any reason are still stored in the general recipient 'bucket'
font.

2) Uncached glyphs. Glyphs which are too large for the cache are rendered as images. The
image handling code has been extensively reworked to try and detect this situation and,
if the criteria for cached glyphs above also holds true, to store the image as a glyph
in a type 3 font and draw text in the PDF content stream instead of an image. Images
which do not fulfil these criteria are still handled as images.

3) Recached glyphs. If the glyph cache fills up, glyphs will be flushed to make space.
If a glyph is then reused we go through the caching case again (for large glyphs which 
are uncached we end up repeating the code every time the glyph is used). We now attempt
to spot this by determining that the glyph in the font has already been used, and rather
than storing a new copy of the glyph, as the old code did, we simply emit text into
the page content stream.

Note that there is a recommendation that inline images in PDF should not exceed 4KB. 
Since CharProcs must use inline images, bitmaps which exceed this size will be rendered
as images, not text (they will also exceed the cache size and so are always rendered
uncached).

<pre>
In the event that we've decided not to cache a glyph generated by FAPI, we
need to make sure that zsetcachedevice2() doesn't opt to try to cache said
glyph. To do that we were setting in_cachedevice to CACHE_DEVICE_NOT_CACHING
before calling zchar_set_cache(), and setting it back to its previous value
on return. Unfortunately, a font with a CDevProc causes the call to
zsetcachedevice2() to be delayed until after execution of the CDevProc, so
in_cachedevice was (probably) no longer set to CACHE_DEVICE_NOT_CACHING.

Amongst other effects, this caused some anti-aliased glyphs to be render
with incorrect, scaling as well as the potential for marking glyphs to have
empty (but valid) cached bitmaps.

Expected cluster differences: fts_23_2306.pdf at 72dpi shows some (benign)
pixel differences on the pattern filled glyphs - this is actually a behaviour
progression, as it is caused by cache being properly bypassed for an uncached
glyph, rather than the glyph being rendered uncached but the cache receiving
an emtpy glyph.

Code to speed up cases where a file contains a lot of small images that are embedded in the clist as high level images.

Black and White Tiff based devices were not respecting the AdjustWidth
parameter. Fax based devices were applying it regardless, non faxed based

all default to applying it, but be controlled by the option.

In this commit, we change so that all black and white tiff based devices

fax devices, and not applying it in non-fax devices, so default behaviour
does not change. We also update the docs.

Fix bug reported by Norbert Janssen. Inaccuracies in the floating point maths
can cause 'no-scales' to look like 'downscales', and so high level images are
skipped.

This shouldn't actually matter in most cases as the two rendering paths should
give the same results, but when people hook the clist for their own purposes
this can cause problems. The workaround is to introduce a fudge factor and to
accept very slight downscales.

Add a helpful valgrind header, and call it from gsmdebug.h.

The valgrind header here serves 2 purposes.

Firstly, it insulates us from platforms on which Valgrind does not exist -
if we build without defining ENABLE_VALGRIND then no dependency on any
valgrind headers exists. The standard Valgrind macros are all defined in
this header to do nothing, so they can safely be called in our code
without needing ugly #ifdef ENABLE_VALGRIND wrapping.

Secondly, it insulates us from changes in the valgrind/memcheck.h file -
if ENABLE_VALGRIND is defined we will use whatever version is defined by
the system. If new macros are defined by new versions of valgrind/memcheck.h
we simply need to add new 'empty' definitions to valgrind.h.

To start with, the only use of this code is to mark the contents of newly
allocated blocks as being undefined. Thanks to AlexCher for spotting a
cunning place to do this.

Disable the use of high level images in the clist if we are downscaling;

Firstly, it fixes the potential problems with banded/unbanded mismatch

code. These calculations are no longer correct for downscales since the
change to use a simpler interpolated image scaler.

Secondly, when downscaling we will probably end up copying more data than
we would if we just kept the original, so high level images are a bad idea
anyway.

This *should* produce no differences, but actually produces lots.

Most of these might be ignorable (slight rendering differences that appear to
result in the new images being a little lighter, but a significant number
appear to be noticable progressions, which hints that the high level image
clist code is broken. Specifically high level images fail to  render the

Fix (pdfwrite) : Update CFF interpreter to handle gsubr while searching for SEAC

Bug #691680 &quot;PDF Writer drops many accented characters&quot;

pdfwrite makes use of a routine 'gs_type1_piece_codes' while copying fonts to determine
if a glyph is a SEAC, and therefore includes two subsidiary glyphs. This code was
updated previously (rev 10076) but on encountering a callgsubr in a CFF font, assumed
that the glyph was not a SEAC&gt;

This patch adds support for callgsubr and continues searching glyphs which use a gsubr
to see if the gsubr is actually a SEAC type endchar.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Scale up type 3 font outlines to give more accuracy

Bug #691383, #691287, #691595 various type 3 font problems.

Although this is being fixed for the FreeType implementation, the Artifex font
interpreter had similar problems. 

The issue is caused by using an identity scale at 72 dpi to capture font outlines.
Quark often uses a type 3 font which runs a type 1 font, in order to achieve text
special effects, such as stroke+fill. The stroke was achieved by a 'charpath/fill'
combination, because pdfwrite doesn't have a charpath, this meant that the path was
captured and emitted. Because the scale was so low, the interpreter could run out of
arithmetic precision, resulting in poorly formed outlines.

We can't simply use the CTM in force at the time, as that includes the font scale, but
we need to use something other than the identity. A scale facto of 1000 proved too 
likely to cause arithmetic overflow, or clipping, and also meant writing large values
to the PDF file, which is inefficient. A factor of 10 turned out to be insufficient, so
a factor of 100 has been used.

Because the CharProc is effectively interpreted at the page level, this can result in
large values being used for paths, so we need to scale the device width and height by
100 as well, to prevent clipping (and undo it afterwards!)

Fix (pdfwrite) : Properly scale co-ordinates into Acrobat's range

When emitting various co-ordinates pdfwrite is careful to stay within +/- 32,767 in
order to ensure all versions of Acrobat can properly deal with them. To achieve this it
emits a matrix which scales values up, and then writes the co-ordinates scaled down
by this factor. Thus ensuring that they stay within permitted values, but are still
correct.

However, when emitting a rectangular fill, the scale was applied backwards, the 
co-ordinates were scaled *up* instead of down by the scale factor. This led to wildly
incorrect values being written for rectangular paths.

No differences expected with this in the test suite, however it forms part of the fix
for type 3 fonts which will follow and does rely on this change.

Update interpolation filter. When we are downscaling an image on either axis
we now use a simpler (less computationally complex) linear interpolation
filter rather than the existing mitchell filter.

For downscaling the difference in quality between mitchell and simple
linear interpolation is not that noticable. (But the CPU/memory usage is a
quarter what it would be for proper mitchell downscaling).

What is noticable is that the existing downscaling code is 'bent' to avoid
having to hold more than 8 temporary scaled scanlines of the image. The effect
of this is to incorrectly limit the pixels that actually go into contributing
to an output pixel, producing dropouts.

We update the code here to remove this limit. This means that downscales
may potentially take more memory and more computation to perform, but the
overall quality is better.

Regression tests show both noticable and unnoticable differences in files that
enable interpolation (270 or so). The noticable differences are all that the
new output looks smoother, at the expense of losing some contrast and solving
some 'jaggy' looking edges.

Testing with my custom dropout test file shows a huge improvement with the
new code. I'll add this to the test repo shortly.

Fix for a large memory leak that can occur when a pattern cache entry is freed and a transparency buffer exists in the entry.

The close device proc for the pdf14 device contains the calls to actually free the buffers so this was not occurring (instead we were forwarding to another device).  In addition, the pdf14 device itself was not being destroyed.  With this commit, when the pattern entry is freed, the  pdf14 device is now closed, which frees the buffers, and the pdf14 device is properly reference count decremented to result in the device itself getting freed.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Process text in Tr 3 even if the Widths are non-standard

Bug #691605 &quot;Invisible text not preserved by pdfwrite&quot;

The problem was that if text in text rendering mode 4 (neither stroke nor fill) used a
font where the entries in the FontDescriptor /Widths array did not match the actual 
widths in the font, the code took a path where the glyphs were not added to the 'used'
list, and so were never emitted.

Text in regular fonts where the /Widths array was missing, or matched the widths in the
font (as the spec says they must) worked correctly.

Fixed by processing text whose operation properties include TEXT_RENDER_MORE_3 the
same as text with the TEXT_DO_DRAW property.</pre>

Fix (pdfwrite) : Check encoding compatibility when finding base fonts

Bug #691656 &quot;crash in Chinese font: /typecheck in --.FAPIBuildGlyph--&quot;

A typecheck error is not a crash of course, but when using the built in font interpreter
this did not produce an error, silently discarded the text instead. This was still
incorrect.

The problem is caused when dealing with type 0 fonts and producing multiple type 1 fonts
to handle the large number of glyphs. The code for finding an existing font (in order
to minimise the number of new fonts) or create a new font, did not consider the 
encoding of an existing font when trying to match it (this did work for regular fonts).

This could lead to a font with an incompatible encoding being used, which caused an
error later in text processing where a routine is supposed to be guaranteed no font
encoding problems. That led to an attempted fallback to the 'bitmapped type 3 font'
solution, but the text processing was passing ridiculous values to the font interpreter.

In the old font code this caused a silent discard of the text, with the FreeType code 
it produces an error.

Fixed by checking the base font we find to see if its encoding is compatible with the 
current text encoding, and manufacturing a new font if it is not.

No differences expected.

If we don't do something with that value then gcc complains that the 'statement has no

ecode = gs_note_error(error code);

Fix for part 1 of bug 691484 - uninitialised memory usage in clist code.

The FAPI code copies bitmaps and pads them out so that each raster line
is appropriately aligned. Previously the padding bytes were left
uninitialised. Unfortunately the clist code reads the padding when
compressing the bitmaps, which a) upsets valgrind and b) means that the
exact size of the clist will vary from run to run.

Here we tweak the copying code to ensure that the padding bytes are always
set to zero.

Fix (pdfwrite) : ConvertCMYKImagesToRGB not working

Bug #691647 &quot;-dConvertCMYKImagesToRGB no longer works&quot;

Originally caused by the conversion to the ICC workflow, which meant that all images
appear to be in a ICC space, and only images originally natively CMYK are converted.

Probing the ICC space using the provided utility to return the original colour space 
allows the code to work, but reveals a more serious error. The code in
psdf_setup_image_filteres() alters the image colour space and decrements the reference
count of the original colour space.

This seems logically correct, and in one of the three calling paths it is correct, but
under one of the other two conditions it causes a crash. The routine 
pdf_begin_typed_image_impl() makes two copies of the original image parameters, and
when it does so it does *not* increment the reference counts of any counted objects.
This copied data is presented to the image filter setup several times, and if CMUK
to RGB conversion is going on the original colour space is decremented each time. This
leads to obvious problems.

The simplest solution would be to increment the reference counts when the copy is made, 
but that would mean checking all the error condition break outs, and decrementing the
reference count in each case.

Since the colour space is only decremented in the filter setup, this patch increments
the count before the call, and if the colour space is the same afterwards (whether
an error occurred or not) decrements it back again. If the colour space changes we do
not decrement the space of course, as the filter setup routine has done that.

In addition, extended the test for whether CMYK images should be converted to include
the original test of the native space, in case we get here after an image has been
converted to a base space and no longer has an ICC space.

No expected differences, this configuration is not tested by the regression suite.

Fix (pdfwrite) : allow for UserPasword and OwnerPassword in page device

Bug #691256 &quot;OwnerPassword and UserPassword don't work as device parameters&quot;

pdfwrite sets up encryption filters when the device is opened, and the device is not
(currently) closed until Ghostscript shuts down. This means that changes to the page 
device dictionary which require a restart (eg the encryption parameters) do not affect
the current setup, though they may be (incorrectly) written when the device is closed.

This patch addresses the specific issue of OwnerPassword by closing the device if the
password is changed *and* we have not yet written any pages. If we have already begun
the output when a password change occurs then we ignore it and flag a warning.

This is also a first step in the direction of making pdfwrite open and close properly
so that we don't need to restart Ghostscript to use it.

Fix (TrueType fonts) : memory leak

Bug #691088 This does not affect the PostScript/PDF interpreters which now use FreeType
but is relevant still for XPS and PCL.

A buffer was allocated to contain the GSUB table from the TT font, but was never freed
leading to memory leaks. I've adopted the same approach as that taken for the 'glyph
length' array and added a notification procedure which is called when the font is 
released, and that procedure frees the GSUB buffer.

At the same time, removed the functions:
add_quadratic_curve
append_simple
check_component

These were only called by each other, or by append_component which had already been
removed as unused.

No expected differences.

Fix so that objects tag information makes it through transparency rendering AND the clist.  An issue was that the pdf14 encode and decode procedures are used as opposed to the target device encode and decode procedures and it is through a value in the color index that we currently communicate the object type through the clist.  When we are in page rendering mode, it is easy to get the current object from mem-&gt;gs_lib_ctx-&gt;BITTAG, but this is not set correctly in clist rendering if for example a glyph is stored in the clist as a mask fill.  Instead the information about the object is extracted from the color index.  So, to make this work, we had to introduce an encode method for the pdf14 device that incorporates the tag information and also make sure that the bit depth for the pdf14 color info value is incremented appropriately so that the extra byte is stored and extracted from the clist.  The object type is then recovered during the pdf14 mark fill rect procedure.  This was tested with the updated bitrgbtags device using a custom file that has overlapping text, image and path objects with varying transparency amounts.   </pre>

Final part of the fix for bug 691612.

Currently the code blindly sets the &quot;lop_pdf14&quot; whenever the pdf14 device is
in use. This forces the 'lop_is_idempotent' test to fail, which in turn forces
slower cases to be taken through the code.

This patch alters that logic, so that the pdf14 device can leave that bit
unset if the parameters are set up in such a way that the lop really can
be idempotent (i.e. normal blending, solid alphas etc).

This vastly improves the speed of rendering non-alpha content, so we are no
longer penalised for having just a small amount of transparent content on a
page.

Testing shows 398 files that change, but bmpcmp reveals these all to be very
small changes to do with whether individual pixels are filled or not. This
is consistent with the typical mismatches between special case and normal
renderings, so can safely be ignored for now.

In order the fix the bug, we'd like it to call through the device version

Fix (pdfwrite) : Do not write Encodings with Symbolic TrueType fonts

Bug #690744, #691036, #691319. The PDF specification makes it clear that Symbolic
TrueType fonts should not have a FontDescriptor which contains an Encoding entry.
pdfwrite has specifically been doing this, the reason being (code comments) :

	 * We write True Types with Symbolic flag set.
	 * PDF spec says that &quot;symbolic font should not specify Encoding entry&quot;
	 * (see section 5.5, the article &quot;Encodings for True Type fonts&quot;, paragraph 3).
	 * However Acrobat Reader 4,5,6 fail when TT font with no Encoding
	 * appears in a document together with a CID font with a non-standard CMap
	 * (AR 4 and 5 claim &quot;The encoding (CMap) specified by a font is corrupted.&quot;
	 * (we read it as &quot;The encoding or CMap specified by a font is corrupted.&quot;,
	 * and apply the 1st alternative)). We believe that AR is buggy, 
	 * and therefore we write an Encoding with non-CID True Type fonts.
	 * Hopely other viewers can ignore Encoding in such case. Actually in this case 
	 * an Encoding doesn't add an useful information.

Since this is working around a bug in old versions of Acrobat, and the presence of an
Encoding causes preflight errors and is specifically forbidden in PDF/A, this work
around has been removed. I would like to check recent versions of Acrobat to see if 
this issue persists, but am unable to find an example file. The change predates the
adoption of Subversion, the first logged change is October 2003.

Addition of support to enable persistence of objects tag information through transparency rendering.    In the current code base, transparency blending erases all knowledge about the objects that were drawn and blended, setting the entire object to image type.   With this commit, the tag information is retained through blending by doing a bit-wise or of the tag values.  When a device supports tags, the pdf14 device will create an additional plane to maintain the tag data information.  Blending of the tag information occurs in pdf14_mark_fill_rectangle, pdf14_mark_fill_rectangle_ko_simple and pdf14_compose_group.   A new device procedure called put_image is added.  This is called by the pdf14_put_image operation, which enables the communication of the tag information to the target device.  pdf14_put_image will first attempt to pass the alpha channel and the image data not scaled by the alpha channel and the tag data to the target device.  The planar offset location of the alpha and tag data is communicated in the put_image procedure interface.  If the target device cannot handle this form of the data, it should return 0.  The pdf14_put_image operation will then blend the alpha data and attempt the put_image again but this time with an alpha offset of 0 to indicate that there is no alpha data.  Note that the alpha data remains valid for those devices that still want the alpha but also want to have the graphics library do a premultiplcation of the alpha with the data.  Details of this interface will be added to the documentation.  In addition, the bitrgbtags device is being updated to demonstrate the use of the put_image procedure.</pre>

Another partial fix for Bug 690993. The sole remaining Valgrind warning
is that memcpy is called on overlapping src/dst blocks in cmd_read_data.

Investigation supports this, and suggests that we should be using memmove

This also appears to resolve the indeterminism, in that repeated runs
of the command line given in the bug return identical results.

The bug remains open though, as there is still a mismatch between banded and

Partial 'fix' for Bug 690993. When encoding a bitmap into a clist, we
copy it into a block with potentially larger padding requirements. These
extra padding bytes were left undefined, causing subsequent attempts to
compress the bitmap to cause valgrind to give warnings.

The fix is simply to introduce and use a new function that copies a bitmap
and zeros the padding. This should eliminate the warnings, produce better
compression, and (more importantly) mean that every run uses the same amount
of memory, hence eliminating potential odd effects where clists may be of
different lengths on different runs.

This still leaves bug 690993 open.

Fix (ps2write) : Bug #689419 &quot;Text missing if nested BT with opdfread.ps&quot;

Type 3 fonts which select another font and then draw text from it (a common feature of
Quark Xpress) can result in nested 'BT' operators when processed by ps2write.

The opdfread prologue does not cater for this, specifically the TextMatrix is not saved
and restored around a BT/ET pair. If the text matrix is altered by the font
selection, then the 'ET' will not restore the old matrix leading to incorrectly sized or
disappearing text.

The patch (supplied by SaGS) saves the TextMatrix in a stack (stored in an array) and
restores the matrix after an ET, in case it is nested. Currently this allows for 
nesting up to 20 deep, which should be more than adequate. Note that if we were to 
encounter a nested BT with no ET this would still fail, but in this case the file 
produced by ps2write would be invalid, and the missing ET should be fixed.

No differences expected, the regression suite doesn't test ps2write.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Don't colour convert SMask images

Bug #690612 &quot;PDF sRGB conversion loses images&quot;

The handling of SMask images in pdfwrite is a bit convoluted. These are handled by 
converting initially to a DevicePixel colour space, then detecting that later and
replacing with a DeviceGray space. However, after doing so, if ColorConversionStrategy
was set, the space (and image samples) would be converted to another colour space. This
is not legal for SMask images.

This code simply checks to see if the image is an SMask before setting colour conversion
and doesn't convert the colour space/samples if it is and SMask.

pdfwrite enhancement : performance improvement with type 3 fonts

Bug #690575 &quot;PS to PDF Conversion extremely slow (possibly endless)&quot;

The type 3 font code assembles CharProcs for type 3 fonts by writing them individually 
into a 'cos_stream'. Each time a new one is completed it is compared to all the existing
CharProcs to see if it is a duplicate. This was done by fseek/fread/memcmp operations.

As the number of CharProcs increases, the time spent seeking, reading and comparing
the data increases dramatically and performance becomes very poor. Not only that, but
the test is actually done twice for each new CharProc.

This patch tackles the problem by creating an md5 hash of the data written to a 
cos_write_stream (a subclassed cos_stream) as it is written. The cos_stream 'equal'
routine checks to see if the md5 hash is valid and if it is then compares the hashes.
If the md5 hash is not valid (ie not a cos_write_stream) then it uses the old 
seek/read/compare mechanism. This will improve the performance of any stored data
if it is stored using a cos_write_stream and compared against other data of the same 
type. (I don't believe we do this anywhere else currently, but I'm not suer)

This does improve the performance significantly, and the code no longer spends most of
its time waiting for I/O operations to complete. It is still slow, but this is the 
result of using lots of type 3 fonts. Because of the way these must be processed in 
order to capture the outlines they are never going to be fast.

In my test this runs 2-3 times faster than before. There should be no differences in
output from the old code.
