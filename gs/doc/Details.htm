<pre>
Slight refinement in the how the FAPI character generation detects we are
producing anti-aliased glyphs.

Also, it seems that when assigning variable value to a second, larger data
type, whilst gcc promotes the data type before the assignment, MSVC promotes
the variable later, so shifting a 32 bit integer up during an assignment to
a 64 bit integer variable works find on gcc, but MSVC loses the most
significant bits. So we need to force the promotion to happen with a cast.

<pre>
Some fairly substantial changes to the FAPI code to get very high resolutions and
anti-aliased text working reliably.

For AA text, we now make *sure* to produce outlines for non-cached glyphs, thus
the GS path code can anti-alias correctly (for cached glyphs, the &quot;show&quot; machinery
does the anti-aliasing from the cache bitmap).

The high res problems were highlighted by the bbox device (which runs at 4000 dpi).
To resolve these the width and height parameters for Freetype had to have value
overflow compensation added, to match the existing underflow compensation.

FAPI/Freetype also now will only create a glyph bitmap if the bitmap size is smaller
than the allowable glyph cache bitmap. It may still produce a bitmap for a non-cached
glyph, if the cache is full, but the individual glyph bitmap is not larger than the
allowable glyph item - this is allow for better consistency when we're near the limit
of the total cache size.

Finally, the FAPI outline retrieval code now requires 32.32 fixed point variables (rather
than the previous 16.16), which prevents overflow, and improves accuracy. If also provides
us with the opportunity to check for overflow/underflow of the GS internal fixed point
variables, before calling the GS path code.

There are quite a few cluster changes. I have checked them all, and one is a progression
(missing glyphs now render) and the rest are the pixel level differences expected by
having GS render a path, rather than Freetype - most are due to Freetype grid fitting to
the glyph bitmap, and GS grid fitting to the page raster.

Fix (pdfwrite) : string not being re-encoded

Bug #690441 &quot; Files render properly with gs, but are misformatted by ps2pdf&quot;

A Coverity fix in revision 9072 prevented a crash, but also circumvented code that was
essential to run under some conditions. (This is described by comments in the code as a
'trick'). The routine created a text string with the encoded text for a font with a
custom encoding derived from a CIDFont with an unusual CMap.

In order to avoid the potential crash, but still re-encode the string, which is
essential, the relevant portion of the code has been copied and is exercised instead of
executing 'pdf_reserve_char_code_in_pdfont()'. This produces the reencoded string we
need, but if the encoding fails, where we would have caused a crash by dereferencing a
NULL pointer, we instead return an error.

No differences expected, we obviously don't have a test case in the regression suite.

<pre>
pdfwrite enhancement

The addition of code to test and honour the 'embedding flags' in TrueType fonts has
led to problems because PostScript producers are embedding type 42 fonts in the
PostScript which are non-embeddable and worse use a custom non-reversible encoding,
so that the  resulting PDF file has garbage text when a normally encoded font is used
as a replacement.

It seems that Adobe has published a 'white list' of fonts which have been granted
at least some embeddable rights. It isn't obvious if these are fonts which were type
1 (and therefore could be converted to TrueType and get incorrect embedding rights) or
if the fonts were originally released as TrueType with the wrong embedding rights.

In any event, this list has now been added to pdfwrite; if a font is encountered which
has restricted embedding, then its name will be checked against this list, if it is
found in the list then it will be considered as embeddable. We have already 
encountered one font on this list which has a slightly different name to the original
(a space was removed) so spaces in the font names are ignored. 

This list will have to change over time, and we may find other examples of characters
which we want to handle specially (eg oumlaut treated as o and e)

No differences expected as this is not tested in the current regression suite.

Fix (pdfwrite) : linewidth corruption when Tr is 1

Bug #690436 &quot; (regression) re-distilling pdf causes R graphics to go block-single-color.&quot;

The problem was cause din the pdfwrite-specific text rendering routines. When the text
render mode is 1 (stroke), the linewidth is adjusted by the current text matrix. However
the routine to do this is called each time any element of the text 'graphics state'
changes. So if multiple calls to (eg) Td were made, the linewidth would be altered
even though there had been no change in 'w'.

Fixed by getting the current linewidth before the text rendering routine, and setting
it back to this value after the text rendering routine.

No expected differences. However z400454b01d4-1.pdf seems to exhibit some minor
differences which I am unable to reproduce locally. They are so minor that bmpcmp
ignores them, and on my tests the PDF files are identical bar the date/time stamps
and other metadata. I don't believe this is a real difference.

Fix (pdfwrite) : faulty matrix transformations for Pattern dictionaries

Bug #690398 &quot;Geometric issue with pattern&quot;
The problem is the definition of the default co-ordinate space. When a Pattern is at the
page level or drawn inside a form, we need to remove our 0.1 scaling in order to return
to the 'default co-ordinate space'. However, when painted on a form nested inside a
form, the default co-ordinate space is the parent form, so we don't need to undo
the scaling.

Fix (pdfwrite) : FormDepth not tracked properly.

Part of the fix for Bug#690398. In order to know whether a pattern matrix should be
converted to the top level CTM, or to an enclosing Form CTM, we track the Form Depth
by noting when transparency groups begin and end (currently this is the only way to get
a form output by pdfwrite).

There was a problem with mask groups, because although pdf_begin_transparency_mask calls
pdf_begin_transparency_group, pdf_end_transparency_mask doe snot call
pdf_end_transparency_group. This resulted in the depth being incremented at the start
of the mask, but not decremented at the end, so patterns could be emitted at the page
level but with the CTM for a Form level, leading to missing content.

Fixed by decrementing the FormDepth appropriately.

Enhancement - Font copying (pdfwrite)

Bug #691573 &quot; invalidfont in xshow&quot;. The file does in fact contain an invalidfont, the
type 42 embedded fonts are defined by adding /.notdef to the CharStrings dictionary as 
if it were the Encoding array. The key /.notdef is added 256 times with values ranging
from 0 to 255. Of course only the last one is actually defined.

This means that when we come to copy the /.notdef glyph for our font copy, the type 42
GID is 255. However the font does not contain a glyph with GID 255, so the copy of the
font fails.

Although this is an illegal font, Adobe Acrobat Distiller does produce a PDF file from
it. In order to duplicate this, code has been added when copying a font. If we fail to
copy a glyph, and the glyph is /.notdef and the GID is non-zero, we try to copy a glyph
with GID 0 instead. If that fails we error out, otherwise we use the glyph with GID 0.
(TrueType font /.notdef glyph has GID 0)

This works for the supplied file but is not, of course, a guaranteed solution since 
another badly formed font may not contain a glyph with GID 0.

Fix (pdfwrite) : errors in XMP metadata parsing

Bug #691562 &quot;ERROR -15 closing pdfwrite device&quot;.

This use of a DOCINFO pdfmark exposed 3 separate bugs in pdfwrite's handling of XMP
metadata.

1) Decoding an escaped PostScript string. Unescaped characters and octal escapes worked
correctly, but non-octal escapes moved the index into the string one place too many.

2) The escape '\b' (backspace) wasn't handled and returned incorrect data. Although not
tested by this issue, the form feed (\f) also wasn't handled.

3) When converting UTF16 data to UTF-8, the end of the destination (UTF-8) buffer was
calculated incorrectly, causing a spurious buffer overrun error.

The code now handles the missing escapes, does not advance the character position after
decoding a non-octal escape and correctly defines the end of buffer. After this the
Title string displays the same in Acrobat as the same pdfmark sent through Adobe
Distiller.

No expected differences as this only affects the document metadata.

Enhancement : pdfwrite

performance enhancement for pdfwrite when handling files with large amounts of text.

Bug #689859 &quot;Performance comparison versions 7.07 and 8.62 on HP-UX ia64&quot; Alex's
analysis shows that pdfwrite was spending a lot of time trying to to see if two type 1
fonts were the same before deciding whether a glyph could be added to a font, or was 
already present in a font copy.

Most of the time was spent extracting and comparing /Subrs. The new code creates a hash
(MD5) of both the local and global Subrs (if present) and stores that in the type 1
'data' field in the font (16 bytes). The hashes are created by pdfwrite only as they 
are required, so there is no performance penalty for rendering. The hash comparison is
considerably quicker than the long winded Subrs comparison.

For many files the performance difference is minimal but for file containing lots of
pages, mostly composed of text, there is a considerable saving. The text files run in
about 60% of the time they did before this change.

The &quot;show&quot; machinery expected that even non-marking text operations
(such as stringwidth) would result in a glyph bitmap which
could be cached (assuming the glyph would be a candidate for the
cache with a normal marking operation, like show).

FAPI, however, did not create a glyph bitmap for non-marking
operations, thus the cache would receive a valid, but
&quot;empty&quot; glyph. This caused Postscript that used stringwidth
before a show to sometimes &quot;lose&quot; glyphs, by using the empty
cached glyph.

FAPI's behaviour now matches the expectations of the show/cache
management code.

A piece of data (pointer to glyph data) was stored and passed into a routine

to the text enumerator data. NB the text enumerator is saved and restored around the
call.

Modified so that the calling routine makes a copy of the glyph data before calling

Fix for Bug 691504 (gs taking a long time to render a file).

Revision 8694 changes code from using a simple cast to an int to using
a call to (int)floor. This fixes problems, but costs a factor of 3 in
processing time for heavily tiled files.

Here we change to using a macro version of floor instead. This removes
the function call and NaN handling overheads and returns us to the
same kind of performance as we had before.

We apply the same change throughout the file (i.e. all the calls to (int)floor,
not just the two changed in r8694.

There is still scope for optimising this code further, but this closes the
regression.

No differences seen in local cluster testing.

Assorted fixes for the modularized X11 output device

All object files destined for shared libraries needed to be compiled
with -fPIC but this is not the case for gsparamx.c, gdevemap.c, and
gdevxcmp.c which are required by other parts to be built as standard.

This change makes x11 not depend on gsparamx.c and gdevemap.c (and not
geeting them included in the shared library X11.so). gsparamx.c is
part of psdf and is usually included and available, and gdevemap.c is
small enough to be inserted completely where it is used.

gdevxcmp.c is addressed by building it with $(GLCCSHARED) and not with
$(GLCC).

In addition, $(CC_SHARED) is only used for object files, rather than
for linking, so DYNAMIC_CFLAGS is more appropiate here than
DYNAMIC_LDLAGS.

Fix (pdfwrite) : try not to write out invalid xref

Exposed by bug #691503. There are circumstances under which we create a reference to a
/Page object which does not yet exist (creating an outline tree for example). In this
case we create a reference to the page, and set its initial offset to the current 
position in the PDF file. When we later write the real object we update the position
to reflect the point in the file where it is actually stored.

However, if we don't actually ever write the object (in the case above, because
LastPage is set before the destination page), then the object remains pointing to the
wrong location in the file. This is then written into the xref table, and this confuses
the current version of Ghostscript.

The patch creates new pages with an offset of 0 (which is always invalid because the 
PDF header means the minimum offset for any object is 15). If the page is later
created then the offset gets updated. If it is not written, however, we now check in 
the xref writing code to see if an object has an offset of 0. If it does, then we
break the xref table up and do not write an xref entry for the missing object.

Ghostscript is happy with this and processes the file.

NB the proper fix is to not emit the Outline entry for the page which will not be
present in the output, and a patch has been suggested to achieve this. This code has
some uses, however, as it may prevent this kind of problem in the future. It also
permits objects to be created and never referenced (presumably because they are never
used) without leaving invalid entries in the xref, which might be useful.

No expected differences.

<pre>
Two changes for two primarily pdfwrite problems with FAPI/FT.

The first is to only replace whichever of BuildGlyph or BuildChar
procedures the original font actually contained, replacing both
regardless confused some of &quot;decoding&quot; code elsewhere in GS
(op_show_continue_dispatch()) and we ended up receiving a valid
glyph to render instead of notdef. In this case we ended up incorrectly
stroking a charpath (this was seen with Quark's Type 3 &quot;special effects&quot;
font). With rendering output this resulted in a boldening effect on the glyph,
in pdfwrite, the result was strange extra lines through the glyph.

The second change is to due pdfwrite's use of a unit matrix for some of
its work. This resulted in small glyph metrics rounding to zero within
Freetype, and pdfwrite thinking a glyph had a width of zero. So make
the scale value at which we consider a glyph to be &quot;small&quot; an order of magnitude
larger, which gets compensated for in the calculation of Freetype's final
matrix.

Unfortunately this does cause ~2600 differences in the cluster tests: some
are progressions, most are pixel differences due to rounding differences
because the scaling numbers have changed in Freetype.

I had needlessly attempted to have 2 pattern_cache's, one for stroking

indexed by color id number, this is not necessary as all the data can
live happily in just one instance.

This removes the problem seen in the bug (where it was getting into an
infinite loop trying to populate the cache).

Local cluster testing shows this produces 57 differences, all (I think)

This code has been tested with MSVC and on linux with pthreads. While it
should work with Borland and Watcom (as all the headers appear consistent)
I have not been able to properly test it. Therefore the code is currently
configured to fall back to the old code, thus hopefully guaranteeing that
this commit won't make the operation under Borland/Watcom any worse than
it is now. This fallback is controlled by a single define for each of
these systems in gp_wsync.c, so it's easy to test. If users can report
success with the new code we can remove the fallback trivially.

A much better solution for Bug 691328.

The bitmap data coming from a font scaler/renderer may not have its raster
alignment as Ghostscript expects, so in the event that is the case, create
a bitmap which is GS compatible in the FAPI layer, before calling any
further operations on it.

This reverts the previous &quot;hack&quot; from r11362.

either. ps2write includes procedures to create a well formed Type 42 from
a TrueType font.

The error is caused by .dividesfnts only spliting strings when the split
offset is even. The sample file has a *long* run of cases where the split
offsets are odd. When an even offset is finally found, the number of buffered
bytes exceeds the maximum length of the string causing /rangecheck error.

Fix for bug 691478

Note that string objects that are maintained as user params must be either allocated in non-gc memory or be a constant in the executable. The problem stems from the way userparams are retained during garbage collection in a param_list (collected by currentuserparams).  For some reason this param_list does not get the pointers to strings relocated during the GC. Note that the param_dict itself is correctly updated by reloc, it is just the pointers to the strings in the param_list that are not traced and updated. In this particular case, ICCProfilesDir sets a string in the icc_manager. When a reclaim occurs, the string is relocated (when in non-gc memory and when it is noted to the gc with the proper object descriptor).  Then if a set_icc_directory occurs, the user params pointer has NOT been updated and validation problems will occur.  Fix for this was to make the string not known to the GC and to allocate in non-gc memory.  When icc manager is deallocated, the string is also deallocated.</pre>

Update trunk to FreeType 2.4.1

The important change (from Ghostscript's point of view) is that the previously
patented TrueType hinting operations have been enabled by default after the
expiration of the patents in question.

This change (the hinting being enabled) causes 3060 non-pdfwrite cluster
changes, and 655 pdfwrite changes - these are expected, and are

<pre>
Fix the bug that prevented recognition of GenericResourceDir/Category/Name
as a valid resource path and required inclusion of GenericResourceDir in
the search path to find the same resource by searching.

New procedure does the following:
1. Returns GenericResourceDir/Category/Name if it exists.
2. Searches for Category/Name in LIBPATH. Returns actual path if found.
3. For non-existing resources return the same path as (1).

Old implementation added GenericResourceDir twice, didn't close files,
used system memory, called expensive procedures twice, etc.

Regression testing shows trivial differences in 23-07.ps, which prints
the length of ResourceFileName procedure.
This is a partial fix for bug 691408.

Prepend icc directory to device profile name if the default name is used so that we have it during clist reading.  This is a fix for the iccprofiles/ problem in 691408 when compile inits is not used.  Also,  fix so that the profile name is allocated in non-gc memory.  This was a source of issues with the userparams dict not seeming to be traced or at least not getting its members relocated if a profile in the icc manager was relocated.  This fixes the breaking of the psdcmyk device in rev  11499.  Also removal of spurious warning messages.</pre>

Improve Ghostscript operation when current directory is not included in the
search path.
1. Make file path separators at the end of LIBPATH entries optional to reduce
   the number of trivial configuration errors.
2. Search LIBPATH list for valid iccprofiles/ directory as a sibling to
   (Resource) and set it as a default to ensure a valid default.
   This code follows /GenericResourceDir example.
3. Make sure that the path name derived from /GenericFontDir is is not
   searched but other font file names are searched. Earlier code relied on
   a feature of .libfile not searching for an absolute path and failed
   when the path was relative.

Fix for Bug 691444.  Issue was introduced when interpolation max output range was set to be 65535 so that the output could be fed directly into CMM. Problem was for HT output devices like pbmraw the interpolation filter ignored the max range setting and used a max value of the frac range as output.

Improve Windows batch files.
Bug #691440 &quot;Windows bat files use relative paths and write to non-temp dir&quot;

As suggested by Bjorn Martensson in bug #691440. Altered all batch files which call
other batch files so that they prepend the call with the location the original
batch file was executed from. This allows batch files such as ps2pdf.bat to be called
from locations other than the Ghostscript 'lib' directory.

Also altered the location of temporary files created by the batch files to the Windows
temporary folder by using the %TEMP% environment variable. If this variable is not set
for some reason then this will still default to the current directory, as it does now.
This allows batch files to be run from directories which are read only.

Since these files are not used by our (Linux) cluster there will be no differences. I
have tested a number of the scripts, but not all of them. The ones I have tested seem
to work well.

I finally found a reference which states that the %~d batch parameter was introduced
to Windows in NT4, this means that these batch files will likely fail on older versions
of Windows (ie Windows 3.x/95/98). I don't believe we need to support such antiquated
Operating Systems any further.</pre>

Fix : temporary memory device not finalized.

clist_init_data creates a temporary memory device in order to &quot;get the memory planarity
set up&quot;, using a local variable to hold the device. When the function exits the
variable goes out of scope and disappears.

Because the memory device is a forwarding device it increments the reference count of
its target, but because it is never finalized it does not decrement the reference count
when it is destroyed, leading to an incorrect target reference count.

This only affects pdfwrite at present, but it prevents valid PDF files being written
because the file is only terminated when the pdfwrite device reference count reaches
0 and the pdfwrite device is closed.

Added calls to finalize the device before discarding it.

No expected differences.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Named destinations with no /Page not working properly

Bug #691344 &quot;REGRESSION: ps2pdf of 8.70 generates correct hyperlinks but not ps2pdf of
8.71&quot;

The revisions 9779 and 9788 fixed a problem where DOCVIEW pdfmarks without a /Page or
/View entry were producing invalid PDF files, and a problem with DEST pdfmarks arising
from it.

Because DOCVIEW and DEST pdfmarks share some common code in pdfwrite to create a 
Destination annotation in the outptu PDF, this still left some confusion in the code.
The problem was that DOCVIEW pdfmarks need not contain Page or View data, but named 
destinations *must*, but pdfmarks need not specify, in which case the current page is
used.

Added a parameter to pdf_make_dest which allows us to differentiate the two cases and
use the current page number for a named destination if no page is supplied.

The regression suite can't test this non-printing feature, so no differences are 
expected.

Enhancement (pdfwrite) : Fall back to Flate instead of JPEG when an image turns out
short.

Bug #691435 &quot;any PDFSETTINGS besides /default gives dictfull error&quot;

There are two problems; firstly when an error is encountered closing a filter the
error code (-1 or -2 usually) is returned and interpreted as a regular GS error,
resulting in ridiculous error messages. Modified to return ioerror instead.

Secondly, when an image terminates with insufficient data and pdfwrite is creating a
DCT encoded image, we can't complete the image. In this case try to fall back to the
simple Flate compressed stream instead.

Provide more robust behaviour when FT fails to render a glyph. Inistead of silently continuing when FT errors on a glyph, we'll now attempt to use the notdef, if the notdef triggers an error, we signal the error to the GS world. This ensures that any time we expect processing to continue there is valid glyph information available to the cache and other downstream devices.

This causes one regression difference with 34_all.PS, where an extra TTF notdef is rendered.

This patch adds limited support for TrueType collection fonts to pdfwrite and ps2write.

In the PostScript world TTC fonts are never passed down to pdfwrite, we only ever see
TrueType fonts. XPS, however, can pass back TrueType collection SNFTS data. This patch
uses the first font from the TrueType collection and writes that to the output file.
This may be too limited and may require further work in future.

Fix for 691359. Problem tracked down by Alex.  

What lcms is trying to do is to figure out the best prelinearization for the incoming data prior to doing the CLUT interpolation.  In the case when the input is RGB based and the output Gray, lcms was using uninitialized data in constructing is prelinearization.

Tangentially related, there could still be problems with what lcms is doing here if the number of Input channels is 1 and the number of Output channels is 3.  In that case, it is possible (but not likely) that I could have radically different gamma behavior in each of the RGB channels.  Trans in such a case would be constructed based upon only one curve based on the red channel.   In the real world, this is probably not a problem but ideally it would be optimal to use something that provides the best prelinearization in all three channels.  That is an optimization for Marti to do and perhaps is already in lcms2.</pre>

<pre>
Erase patterns with the color white instead of filling the pattern
bitmap with 0 or 255.  

Previously the initialization was only used when anti aliasing was
enabled, now initial erasing is done for all colored patterns,
eliminating a long standing UMR in the pcl code where the pattern was
combined with the destination/source with indeterminate results.  The
UMR manifested in frequent regression reports in the pcl tests
(c321.bin for example), these reports should go away with this change,
though (NB) the change only masks the underlying issue.

Fix (pdfwrite) : limit composite object sizes when producing PDF/A

Bug #691370 &quot;Dictionary size not limited for PDF/A-1&quot;

The PDF/A specification insists that the implementation limitations of Acrobat as
defined in PDF 1.4 should be followed when producing PDF/A files. Accordingly this
limits the size of dictionaries to 4095 and arrays to 8191 when producing PDF/A output.

Since there is no way to ignore the problem, setting the PDFACompatibiltyPolicy to 1
'don't emit the object, carry on producing PDF/A' can't be made to work. Since the 
user has expressed a desire for an output file, we fall back to Policy 0 'Produce a
regular PDF file' instead.

Also extend PDFACompatibilityPolicy to include policy 2 'abort'.

No test file for this case, no differences expected.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Don't emit invalid PDF/A files

Bug #691383 &quot;pdfwrite emits invalid PDF/A when glyphs are missing in the input font.&quot;

If the input file references glyphs which are not in the font, then we could emit a
PDF/A file which also referenced glyph which were not present in the fonts embedded
in the PDF file.

This patch uses the PDFACompatibilityPolicy to control the action in this case, and
avoid emitting invalid PDF/A files.

Also extended the functionality of the PDFACompatibilityPolicy to allow the user to 
abort PDF file production when a valid PDF/A file cannot be produced.

No expected differences as PDF/A production is not tested by regression code.

Fix pdfwrite - device reference counting problem with patterns and XPS

When using XPS as the input PDL, and pdfwrite as the output device, the pdfwrite device
was counted up by pattern accumulator allocation, but the clist accumulator never
counted the device down, leading to a reference count &gt; 1 at EOJ. This meant that
the pdfwrite device wasn't closed, since pdfwrite only emits the PDF file when it is
closed this led to invalid unfinished PDF files.

The code here modifies the behaviour of the pattern management so that we don't use the 
'clist' path for accumulating patterns *if* the device can accumulate patterns itself
*and* the PDL doesn't have_pattern_streams (to avoid pathological PDF file problems)

This resolves the issue with device reference counts and all the FTS XPS files now
produce complete PDF files.

Fix pdfwrite, faulty matrix transformations for Shading dictionaries

Bug #691352 &quot;cairo pdf mis-distilled&quot;

Patterns in PDF are unpleasantly complicated by the need to transform the pattern to
the 'default co-ordinate space'. Normally this means that we undo the resolution scaling
which is normally applied to the CTM.

For page streams this works well, but for forms the 'default co-ordinate space' is 
the space of the parent. For one level of form there is therefore no difference between
the page and the form. When forms are nested however, the lower form's space becomes
that of the parent. This means that patterns inside forms, which are nested inside
another form, need to be transformed to the parent form co-ordinate space, not the
page space.

Since we don't currently emit forms from pdfwrite for anything except transparency
groups what this means in practice is that we don't undo the CTM transformation if 
we are rendering a pattern inside a form, nested inside at least one other form.

this will be restored away along with the font at end of page. Instead make a new

Merge of icc_work branch into trunk.

These changes make the color architecture of the graphics library ICC-based.  All colors are now managed in terms of ICC profiles including PS CIE color spaces, for which equivalent ICC profiles are created.    A big feature of this change is that it makes it very easy to interface a color management module (CMM) to ghostscript.   The default CMM is now littleCMS and the interface to littleCMS is contained in gsicc_littlecms.c .

New member variables were added to the imager state including an ICC manager, which stores the default ICC profiles; a link cache, which reduces the cost of creating links between ICC profiles, and a profile cache which stores color spaces created from PS CIE, PDF CalRGB and PDF CalGray colors spaces.

A new directory named iccprofiles has been added.  It contains the default ICC profiles used if none are specified in the command line.  If COMPILE_INITS=1, these will be included in the ROM file system.  The new command line options related to ICC profiles are described in the Use.htm documentation.

For c-list based rendering, all ICC profiles used in the rendering are stored in the c-list.   During multi-threaded c-list reading, a link cache is associated with the primary reader device and is shared amongst the various threads.

Efficiency improvements were made in the handling of soft mask groups, shading smoothness calculations, and color image rendering.  

For details on the branch, please see the commits that were made within the branch.  There remain indeterminisms to fix.  The files affected include Bug688807.pdf,  Bug688845.eps, Bug690208.pdf, 09-34.PS, CATX0988.pdf,  CATX1028.pdf,  CATX1101.pdf,  CATX5529.pdf.

Rendering issues to investigate include Bug689830.pdf, fts43xx.xps (page 3) (shopping cart image), Bug689880.pdf, Bug691002.pdf, Bug689968.pdf, Bug688584.ps (page 4), catx4949.pdf.
  
Note that the number of differences generated with the merge amounts to pretty much every file.

Fix: device reference counting problem with patterns and clipping

Bug #690572 more details here. The problem was caused by installing a clip device while
drawing a pattern tile. This patch initialises the finalize member of the structure
where the clip device will be created to NULL. If a clip device is required, the member
will be initialised to a real routine. After drawing the pattern cell, if the finalize
routine is non-NULL we execute it.

This correctly dereferences the forwarded device if we create a clipping device.

Some work towards (but not a complete cure for) bug 691030.

Previously XXX_slant_into_trapezoids would check for 2 'simple' cases,
and bale into the fully general fill_slant_adjust function otherwise.
The simple cases were where the top span was a subset of the bottom one, or
vice versa.

Unfortunately the way the code to test for these cases was originally written,
one of these special cases could be used for shaped with vertical sides, and
the other couldn't.

By rewriting the test slightly, both cases can be used with trapezoids that
have one vertical side.

For good measure we also extract the 'rectangle' case out separately.

Cluster testing shows no differences (barring a couple of indeterminisms).

This reduces the output from 5 shapes (2 rectangles, 3 traps) to 3 (2
rectangles, 1 trap). One of the rectangles is still a repeat, but it's
a step in the right direction.

Fix - type 1/CFF font interpreter.
The gs_type1_piece_codes routine interprets a type 1 or CFF glyph program to determine
whether the glyph is composed of two subglyphs (a SEAC).

There was a problem with the CFF opcode cntrmask which did not cater for the case where
it is called with a number of operands on the stack. In this case the operands are to
be interpreted as vstem hints. Because this was not done, the interpreter had the wrong
number of hints, and so did not interpret enough of the following bytes as mask data for
the cntrmask operation. This led to attempting to interpret data as operands, which 
caused corrupted glyphs as well as potential crashes.

This does not appear to be tested by any of our current test files (according to a 
cluster test), so no differences are expected.

Fixes portability issue properly with r11256 (which is identical with r11520),
first discovered by Ralph 6 months ago with r10520 
which results in its being reverted in r10540 .

******************************
    Revert c10520 which causes problems with the MSVC build.
    
    $(CC_) enforces 'ansi' C under msvc32.mak, disabling any Microsoft
    extensions. This often causes problems with 3rd party libraries
    which try to take advantage of those extensions.
    
    This means that the -fPIC flag is again not propagated in the GCC
    build; this is just to unbreak the build until I can test a different
    solution which works on both platforms.
******************************
As Ralph explained then, some of libtiff requires non-ansi extensions to work.

The main culpit is tif_win32.c (which includes &lt;windows.h&gt;) and some of the 
file IO flags not being defined. So this commit fix the ansi issue properly.

<pre>
fix windows build breakage in r11249

This change (defining TIFFCONFIG_SUFFIX) should have been part of 
   r11249 (create tif_config.h for non-autoconf build) 
which in turn should have been part of 
   r11241 (hook up libtiff with non-autoconf build via 
      &quot;make -f base/unix-gcc.mak&quot; and &quot;make -f base/unixansi.mak&quot;)

The explanation is that in r10317 where Lars originally hooked up libtiff,
tif_config.h is generated by libtiff/configure (which is driven by the 
top-level configure), but special provision is provided for non-autoconf build 
(win32 and VMS) by copying from a canned header file.
If one chooses to bypass the top-level configure, *on every platform* 
(win32, VMS, and non-autoconf unix build), one must provide similiar special 
provision as well.

Personally I'll prefer not to support non-autoconf unix build.

FreeType, as there is support in Bitstream for a callback to provide TrueType

There were some fundamental problems with the older version: The so target really
should be built in three distinct stages with three different FLAGS - the 
utils (genarch, gechogs) executable part, the shared library part, and the two final
executable part. The library should be built with the shared-object flags, but neither
of the utils nor the final executables should be built with &quot;-shared&quot;, since they are
executables and not libraries. Hope this is clear.

Fix FAPI interface
There is code in the FAPI interface for replacing a font's /FontBBox entry, this
sometimes has to create a new array to insert into the dictionary, if the old array is
not suitable for storing real values.

The code to do this continued using ref_assign_old, as it had done for replacing the
values in an existing array. This appears to be incorrect, when created the refs in a 
new array are uninitialised so attempting to use ref_assign_old tries to use
uninitialised data. 

Modified to use ref_assign_new instead, as indicated by the comments in store.h

as ShadowText.eps

creates a substitute by altering the CharStrings of the substitute font, replacing
the lower case glyph CharStrings with procedures which 'show' the upper case glyph at a
reduced size.

This ends up in the FAPI code as a t_mixedarray type which was being missed by the check
for a t_array, added previously to handle arbitrary procedures in a type 1 font. After
extending the check to include t_mixedarray it was clear that the SEAC processing was
also messing up the dictionary lookup, so it was necessary to restore a value which
had been overwritten in case a SEAC turned up.

zero-length-font.pdf should now work as it does without FAPI, no other differences
expected.

Fix (FreeType) : illegal use of setcurrentpoint not handled as per Adobe.
Bug #691172, file type1-ce1_setcurrentpoint.ps

The PostScript file includes a font which illegally uses setcurrentpoint to establish an
absolute x/y position. The spec is quite clear that this operator is *only* meaningful
when processing the results of an OtherSubr, so this usage is definitely illegal.

Not only does it use setcurrentpoint but, unlike previous uses we have seen, it does not
simply establish 0,0 as the initial point, which can be safely ignored, it actually
uses it to displace the outline vertically.

FreeType normally just puts two uninitialised variables on the stack, ignores the
setcurrentpoint and pops the two dummy values. Instead, we now push the current x and
y co-ordinates when we get a '0 callothersubr'. In setcurrentpoint we then use the
top two values on the stack to set the current point. This now works for the illegal
usage seen here, the previous illegal usage, and does not break well-formed fonts
which actually use the OtherSubrs to set the point.

Fix (FAPI &amp; FreeType)

Bug #691284 &quot;Error: /unknownerror in --.FAPIBuildChar&quot;
The issue is caused because the PostScript file adds to an existing type 1 font a 
CharString entry which is not in type 1 CharString format. I would have thought this
to be illegal but other PostScript interpreters (specifically Distiller) are happy
with it.

Modifed the FAPI interface so that after retrieving a type 1, non-CID, CharString we
test to see if it is a procedure, if it is, then we return an error from the FAPI
code to the caller (in this case the FreeType interface).

Modified the FreeType interface so that if the CharString retrieval returns an error
we return a  specific (otherwise unused) error to the caller, in this case the
FreeType engine. On return from FreeType to the interface we test for the specific
FreeType error (FT_ERR_Invalid_File_Format) and if this is detected then instead of
returning an error to FAPI, we add one to the character index (to ensure it isn't 0)
and return that to FAPI.

Finally, in the FAPI code, after 'rendering' the glyph, if we were returned a value
&gt; 0 then we assume that 'something went wrong' with the CharString. As a last-ditch
effort we use the return value -1 to retrieve the CharString, and then 'exec' it.

NB if we fail to retrieve the CharString at this level, we return an invalidfont error.

More work towards bug 691207 (global variable removal).

There are 4 places is xps where we do eprintfs that access mem_err_print.
This resolves 1, the other 3 should never be called in files we support.

Resolve 4 const warnings from jasper.

Remove 2 calls to gs_lib_ctx_get_non_gc_memory_t from the cups driver. This
means the only places left calling this are devices in gs\contrib.

Convert calls to errprint_nomem to calls to errprint (in gdevx.c, gxttb.c,
gdevupd.c)

The only places using mem_err_print are therefore:

 * calls to debug printing functions
 * devices in gs/contrib calling gs_lib_gtx_get_non_gc_memory, errprint_nomem,
   and eprintf.
 * jasper calling eprintf.
 * gdevsco.c (but that seems intrinsically single threaded to me as only one
   thing can be using the console at a time, presumably)
 * signal handlers in os2 and iwatc for catching numeric exceptions.
 * Various devices in gs/base still call errprintf_nomem - some in DEBUG only
   code, but some not.
 * The gs_throw_imp function.

I think this may be as good as we can get at this point.

As part of the efforts towards bug 691207 (global variables must be removed)
this commit reduces the reliance on mem_err_print.

Currently all calls to errwrite and errflush get the stdin/out/err details
from a global mem_err_print. For multithreaded gs this will result in output
going to the wrong place if any of them are redirected. This review splits
errwrite into 2 variants, errwrite and errwrite_nomem. The first takes an
explicit mem pointer. The second continues to assume a global one.

The plan is to make everything possible use the first. Currently debugging
calls and some 'stubborn' devices continue to call errwrite_nomem.

Fix (pdfwrite) incorrect ToUnicode CMap.
Bug #691274 &quot;Missing or incorrect ToUnicode when using Identity ordering&quot;

pdfwrite emits ToUnicode CMaps in PDF files which always use 2 bytes for the key
length. That is 0x21 is represented as &lt;0021&gt;, since these are hex strings there should
in fact be no difference between &lt;21&gt; and &lt;0021&gt;. It is clear from the ToUnicode
Mapping file tutorial that this is correct for mapping files.

However, a PDF file is not a CMap file. It appears that Acrobat does not like
beginbfrange data which is padded with zeros (it seems happy with codespacerange and 
destination codes which are 0 padded though).

This patch outputs ToUnicode CMaps which are not padded with 0, ie 0x21 is emitted as
&lt;0021&gt;, for the srcCodeLo and SrcCodeHi parameters in a beginbfrange operation. The
destination codes remain zero-padded.

Technically this would be incorrect for a real CMap file, but we don't write those
out so this should not be an issue. The change is limited to ToUnicode CMaps and does
not affect any other kind of CMap.

I believe the change will affect the data emitted for the beginbfrange,
beginbfchar, begincidchar, beginnotdefchar, beginnotdefrange and begincidrange
operators. It does *not* affect the begincodespacerange operator; although Acrobat
Distiller writes this without zero padding tests show that Acrobat is happy reading
zero-padded code space ranges.

ToUnicode information is not used in rendering PDF files, so regression testing should
show no differences. Local testing of a limited number of files doesn't reveal any
problems, but this change has not been well tested.

Modify the 'C' defaults of the pdfwrite device

Bug #691259 &quot;HPGL graphic followed by raster graphic results in incorrect pdf&quot;
The pdfwrite device is initialised in 'C', and then partly overridden by PostScript
initialisation. The problem is that non-PostScript input does not (cannot) execute the
PostScript initialisation, and so the defaults are left as those done in 'C'.

Not only do these defaults not match the documented defaults in ps2pdf.htm, they are
not particularly well selected. In this case the problem was caused by sending image
data at 150 dpi, but only a single scan line at a time. The default setting for
pdfwrite was to downsample image data to 72 dpi, this caused us to subsample (the 
default downsampling) by a factor of more than 2, which led to our single scan line
becoming less than half a scan line, and so disappearing altogether.

This patch addresses this issue by altering a number of the defaults to more sensible 
values. In particular we disable downsampling and enable image compression for gray
and colour images. This has the fortunate result of making most PDF output files 
smaller than before, even though we are now storing more image data.

Also, the garbage collection is altered slightly; rather than the

move them inline into i_ctx_t and amend the gc routines for that

<pre>
Fix for Bug 691014.  Problem was caused by the fact that we had a soft mask present and a pattern with no transparency.  This means the PDF14 device is installed and more importantly that transparency state pushes and pops occur to keep the softmask in sync with the graphic state.  This particular files pattern is installed as a clist, which happens to not have any transparency.  The transparency state pushes and pops were getting placed into the pattern clist when the Q and q operations occurred in the pattern, which was causing problems since the pattern clist device had no pdf14 device installed to handle such commands.  

The solution is to check, when a transparency compositor action is to occur, if the current device is a pattern accumulator or a pattern-clist device.  If it is, then the pattern instance is checked to see if it has transparency.  If it does not, then the transparency state chance is ignored.  This all occurs on the clist writing phase in the gs_trans functions.  

In addition, a fix was made so that the pdf14custom device sets up it's color information correctly.  For subtractive devices that do not have cmyk process colorants the custompdf14 device is installed.  This pdf14 device was obtaining its color_info from the target device.  The pdf14 device must be continuous tone even if the target device is not. 

Ran a regression test and saw no differences.</pre>

Fix for a problem in the rinkj driver for Epson Stylus Photo 2200.
The code was accessing indexes 4,5,6 in plane_offsets[6] and hence was
running off the end of the array. This was causing a warning at compile time
but never caused a segv as it was merely corrupting the next entry in the
structure which was reset to 0 shortly afterwards.

Presumably the offset for one of the planes would be wrong though causing
a loss of quality.

Remove several occurrences of calls to gs_lib_ctx_get_non_gc_memory_t().
The only code that now needs this is gp_macpoll.c and gp_mspol.c for when
CHECK_INTERRUPTS is defined. This reduces the need for mem_err_print.

The only other code that uses mem_err_print is errflush() and errwrite().
Potentially these could be nobbled for a multithreaded build.

The changes here rely on the memory pointers being set up correctly. While
local cluster testing gives this a clean bill of health, it's possible that
problems will appear with files in the wider world - we'll just have to fix
these as they are reported.

Move CPSI_mode from being a global to living in the libctx, as part of the
efforts for bug 691207 (remove global variables).

I originally tried moving CPSI_mode into the imager state, which would have
been slightly nicer, but had to abandon this due to problems interacting
with the command list code. My first thought to make this work was to
push the value of CPSI_mode into the clist at initial clist creation time.
As the setting of CPSI_mode isn't vectored through the device, we can't
detect changes in its setting, but then changing CPSI_mode during the
lifespan of a clist would give unpredictable results anyway in many cases.

Sadly this was doomed to failure as if a page device is started up that
uses the clist code to do banding, then the command list is created before
CPSI_mode is enabled, and we'd operate with the incorrect value.

Moving CPSI_mode into libctx means we keep exactly the same behaviour as
we have now. This has required various functions throughout the code to
pass a gs_memory_t * around.

Localcluster testing reveals no problems.

Fix for bug 691244, reported/patch supplied by Norbert Janssen. In
revision 11045, I'd moved some globals into the libctx, which is

NULL. The fix is to use one obtained from gs_lib_ctx_get_non_gc_memory_t,
a call to which happens conveniently to be on the previous line.

Update the clist band list compressor code to work without using global
variables as part of the workd for bug 691207 (remove global variables).

The old code used to call a function to read an initialise global structure,
then based on that allocate storage and copy the structure into it. The new
code essentially does 2 calls; one that serves to get the size, and another
that serves to initialise the newly allocated structure.

To facilitate testing, this introduces a new TEST_BAND_LIST_COMPRESSION
define. If built with this as a define, the code sets the compression
threshold to 1K, thus forcing the use of compression. A local cluster
push with this in reveals just one problem, and that seems to be in the
existing code whereby inflateEnd can be incorectly called on a NULL derived
pointer. A fix for that is included too.

Fix FreeType FAPI
No bug for this (probably should be). Noticed while testing that using a TrueType to
replace a missing CIDFont (ie entry in cidfmap) was rendering the wrong glyphs, and
applying a vertical advance.

The incorrect glyph seems to be because we were incorrectly stating that the character
index was not a glyph ID, which it is in this case.

The second problem was more difficult. FreeType manufactures vertical advance metrics
for all TrueType glyphs, we override those in the incremental interface callback, but
when the TT is a CIDFont on disk, we don't use the incremental interface and so have
no opportunity to override the metric.

Addressed this by checking in load_glyph to see if the current font is not type 1 
(ie its TT), *is* a CIDFont, and is not a vertical font (WMode is 0). In this case
we simply override the vertical advance and maek it 0.

so the GS font scaler will be used.

Fix UFST and enhance FAPI
Define a new API call for FAPI to allow font engines to replace a FontMatrix. This is
to allow FreeType to replace the FotnMatrix with the identity as it makes the 2-step
scaling performed by FreeType simpler.

Modified compute_em_scale so that it uses the new API call instead of blindly replacing
the FontMatrix.

Restored the calculation in FAPI_do_char which unwinds the FontMatrix from the CTM
when calculating the scale factor. Use the new API call to retrieve the desired
FontMatrix rather than pulling it directly from the font as before.

This alters the described 'odd behaviour' of the font substitution code whereby fonts

Fix TrueType interpreter Bug #691227
Another nasty hack for another broken TrueType font. In this case the font tries to 
execute a DeltaP instruction with an argument greater than the number of points in the
glyph, which is an error.

FreeType's interpreter has this comment

      /* XXX: Because some popular fonts contain some invalid DeltaP */
      /*      instructions, we simply ignore them when the stacked   */
      /*      point reference is off limit, rather than returning an */

There are 4 variables in play here. real_rows doesn't actually need to be

vskip1 and vskip2) all go into the 'ep_globals' structure.

There is a subtle change in behaviour here; previously these variables were
initialised to zero on execution start (and again on every flush). Now they
are initialised to zero at the start of every page (and again on every flush).
This means that leftover vskips are no longer carried forwards from page to

The ESC/P based printing code in gdevcdj.c uses various global variables; we

concerned.

This device isn't used in the default build, so no point in testing with the
localcluster. Enabling it locally and doing before/after tests shows that
identical results are given for rendering tiger.eps.

A side effect of this commit is to remove the nasty shadowing of the img_rows

2 small problems in the same code. In the antialiased case, we stroke by
forming 2 paths (one up either side of the line) and then reverse one and
concatenate it. This should happen whenever we meet a closepath, but due to
a misplaced return, was being missed out in some round join cases.

Also, when using a round join in the case where 2 lines meet 'in-line' we
would inadvertently leave the point on the wrong side of the line.

Fix FreeType
When using bitmaps from a TrueType/Type42 font FreeType uses a heuristic approach to
synthesize vertical metrics for the glyphs, including a horizontal advance. As in the 
past, this works well as long as the client knows whether the advance direction is
horizontal or vertical and uses the correct advance.

However we don't know that, so we don't want the vertical advance.

Its easiest jut to have FreeType ignore embedded bitmaps and use the outlines, in which
case we don't get the invented vertical advance. Not only that but the rendered bitmap
is a better match for the cases where we don't have a pre-built bitmap, so consistency
is improved with this patch as well.

'Fix' FAPI with FreeType.

FreeType's hinting is worse than useless for type 1 fonts, its actually harmful. It
distorts the glyph shape because it hints an unscaled outline. While it would be best
to fix FreeType's hinting this is a large project. For now this patch disables FreeType
hinting when handling type 1 fonts.

This resolves many spacing issues as well as fixing the stroke/fill mismatch with 
ia3z3519.pdf and the incorrectly scaled outline in womanface.pdf.

<pre>
In the gs_2_colors branch I had made 2 copies of the color state and swapped
between them. I had included dev_ht as part of this 'split' state, which
was a significant contributor to the slowdown due to it forcing repeated
writing of the halftone data to the clist. Also, it required significant
extra work on every setscreen or setcolorscreen operation.

Discussions with Henry/Ray/Kens et al lead to the realisation this wasn't
required. This patch therefore backs out the dev_ht split, and the changes
to zsetscreen and zsetcolorscreen. Additional code is however required to
clear the 'alternative' dev_color when a halftone is installed to stop the
'swapped out' color pointing to an illegal halftone cache.

This runs through local testing with no diffs showing (though some
strangeness was observed with an earlier version of this patch in
regression testing - Marcos has captured this with bug 691223).

This seems to have helped with the largest slowdowns, but there are still
significant differences in some cases. Very preliminary investigations seem
to show more time being spent in the interpreter/gc mechanism. Continuing
to investigate.

Fix for bug 691115.

In some circumstances, the shading code can get all the way to the point of
marking the screen/page without ever clipping to the relavent region. This
produces cases where we &quot;draw outside the lines&quot;. Often this is masked by
the fact that we only ever draw as far out of the lines as would be covered
by an area of constant color (typically a small area).

The fix for this is to spot the unclipped case when we come to render
trapezoids to the screen, and to clip the trapezoid into (at most) 3
smaller trapezoids.

This causes 104 non-pdfwrite differences, and 24 pdfwrite ones. Examination
using localcuster bmpcmp shows them all to be acceptable.

<pre>
Compute AES cypher tables at compile time instead of run time.

The aes implementation needs some tables of data to perform its
calculations. In a thread-safety review, Henry spotted that the
tables were global variables with no mutex isolation.

I believe this is actually ok. There is a static flag marking whether
the tables are initialized. If they are not, a call to aes_setkey_*
will invoke aes_gen_tables to initialize them, then set the flag.
However, aes_gen_tables operates deterministically, always writing
the same data sequence to the globals. So while there is a race
where two threads could be executing aes_gen_tables at the same time,
or while another thread is accessing the same tables, there is no
read-modify-write step which could create inconsistent data.

Nevertheless, the tables are small relative to our application, and
there is a compile time option XYSSL_AES_ROM_TABLES which generates
the data at compile time and stores it static const. This commit
turns on that option, allowing the compiler to put the data in a
non-writable segment and making the careful thread safety analysis
above unnecessary.

There should be no difference in behaviour, and Henry has verified
that the two code paths result in identical table data.</pre>

Update the list of face substitutions in .substitutefaces to include all the fonts we

Bug #691180, if we have a font defined in the Fontmap then we don't use the additional 
information in a PDF file FontDescriptor. Instead we stick with whatever font the PS
substitution comes up with (if the font is not present). If a member of the family is
not defined we do use the FontDescriptor. This can lead to different choices for the
substitute font. By defining the font in the substitutefaces array we can attempt to get
a consistent result.

This *will* lead to differences in the regression suite as we are now substituting 
different fonts for some missing faces. Apparently only with the test file for this
bug though.</pre>

Change the condition under which we update the overprint device when restoring
a graphics state to be more relaxed; rather than updating if the overprint
state has changed we now update if it was enabled, or it if it is enabled.

The logic behind this is that it will still fire in all the same conditions
it did before, but will also fire when we restore from a state that had it
enabled to another state that had it enabled. This should be entirely
harmless, but will allow the state to be updated in the case where a
colorspace has been updated.

This causes 2 differences in the tests, that only show up in psd files.
All indications seem to be that these files really are identical. But if
they aren't, I believe they should be progressions, rather than regressions.

<pre>
Ongoing bug fixes for #690448.
The FreeType code will synthesize vertical metrics for TrueType (Type 42) fonts which do
not contain a vmtx table. This includes the vertical advance, which will be returned
to the FAPI code, and used even if there were originally no vertical metrics and the
font should not have any vertical advance.

Modified the metrics override callback, called by FT, so that if the font is a TT font,
and this is a vertical metrics call, we set the advance to 0. This prevents the
synthesized metrics from incorrectly advancing the glyph vertically.

This may eventually be a problem if we find a CIDFont with Type42 outlines which relies
on the vmtx table in the font rather than the Metrics2 or CDevProc overrides to position
the glyphs. Since this facility was only added in CPSI 3011 it is unlikely we will ever
encounter such a font. THis has not been done at present, as the information (WMode=1)
is not currently available to the code called from FreeType to override the metrics, 
and would need to be added.

Also, fixed an issue where the 'advance_v' member of the metrics structure was left
uninitialised if a horizontal override took place. This could cause glyphs to be
mis-positioned vertically.

Fix FreeType
Ongoing fixes for bug #690448. In this case FreeType generates vertical metrics for
TrueType (in our case Type 42) fonts which lack vhea/vmtx tables, which is generally
the case.

These metrics are useful to a 'normal' TrueType consumer which has a notion of the
orientation of the writing direction. However in PostScript we don;t know that, so we
apply both the horizontal and vertical advance widths.

If the vertical advance should be 0 (because its not specified) then creating one causes
the glyphs to be misplaced.

This code adds a new load flag to FreeType 'FT_LOAD_NO_SYNTHETIC_METRICS', and sets
this flag in the FAPI FreeType interface code, which prevents FreeType from manufacturing a bogus vertical advance.

<pre>
Add support to the autoconf and msvc builds to compile in a copy of
the FreeType2 library from local source.

Previously, the FAPI bridge for freetype required that the library
be compiled externally and include and link flags passed through
the FT_CFLAGS and FT_LIBS makefile variables. We now include a copy
of the freetype source in the tree, to make it easier to find a
compatible version of the source and to simplify building for
platforms that don't provide a system freetype.

Now, to enable both freetype and the FAPI bridge, pass --enable-freetype
to the configure script. This will set FT_BRIDGE=1 and the other required
variables. The configure script will prefer local source in gs/freetype2
to the copy in gs/freetype to simplify testing against upstream.

To enable freetype in the msvc build, pass FT_BRIDGE=1 on the nmake command
line.

Note that the fallback is now FT_BRIDGE=0, not FT_BRIDGE undefined; this
will require changes in any custom top-level makefiles.

Fixes bug #691147 customer 861, the optimization to strength reduce
the raster operation here is wrong, it is premised on the assumption
the colors are opaque.  If either texture or source is transparent the
strength reduction which effectively ignores the source or pattern is
wrong and it will subsequently cause opaque painting.  We've simply
removed the optimization instead of conditionalizing on opaque cases,
because tests indicate the reduction not that significant.  The
example in the bug report was reduced from a file in the XL ATS 305
test suite.  The following customer reported bugs in that test suite

Fix (pdfwrite)
Bug #691133. If producing PDF/A output. and a DOCINFO pdfmark string was UTF_16BE
encoded *and* contained a numeric character, then decode_escape incorrectly consumed
any numeric characters following the first octal byte of the UTF16 code.

This was caused by decode_escape assuming that octal sequences are terminated by 
non-numeric characters which is clearly wrong. The octal escape decoding loop is now
terminated when :
1) 3 numeric characters are read from the string
2) No more data is available in the string
3) A non-numeric character is encountered in the string.

Tiny tweaks to clusterpush.pl to make it work on windows. First, wrap the
$HOME directory in additional quotes to allow for awkward windows users
with spaces in their names. Secondly, add a crude mapping for people whos
windows names are not the same as the usernames. This can unquestionably
be done more nicely, but the simple version will do for now.

Fix colour processing. It was possible for nested ICCBased colour spaces (ie an ICCBased
space whose Alternate is another ICCBased space) to cause segmentation faults.

This was due to the fact that the conversion to base colour continuation procedure 
'currentbasecolor_cont' was supposed to scan the space from the initial declaration
each time round a loop. However a reassignment of an array pointer caused it to
rescan from the last processed colour array instead.

Normally this does not cause problems, but in the case of nested ICCBased it caused
us to generate an error.

Fixed by re-initialising the array pointer at the start of the loop.

Fix (pdfwrite) bug #691104 &quot;pdfwrite emits garbage in the XMP metadata when DOCINFO
pdfmarks contain UTF-16BE text strings&quot;

There were several problems. Firstly the undoing of PostScript string escapes was wrong,
Octal escapes consumed too many characters, and several escape sequences weren't
recognised.

Secondly the XMP emission didn't expect to receive UTF-16BE strings and didn't convert
them to UTF-8 for inclusion in the metadata.

This patch fixes the broken octal escapes, adds teh unprocessed escapes and checks the
DOCINFo strings before sending to XMP. If they include the UTF-16BE Byte Order Mark
then convert the strings to UTF-8.
