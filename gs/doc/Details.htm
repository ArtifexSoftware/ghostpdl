Work around problems with XInitImage and large rasters.

Patch from Russ Cox, fixes Bugs 689547 and 689561.

Details:

The patch sets bitmap_pad, and passes 0 for bytes_per_line in
cases were current xorg can correctly generate a value. Russ writes:

I have tracked down the problem, and it appears to be a bad interaction
between
gs and recent sanity checking in the X library.

In particular, sometimes x_copy_image in gdevx.c gets called with wide
widths but narrow raster values.  Even though the raster is apparently
wrong, the X graphics operations would work okay with that value.  But
new versions of X11 have various checks in XInitImage, one of which is
that the raster is greater than or equal to the width of the image times
the depth.

To see that this diagnosis is correct, replacing the call to XInitImage
with a call to _XInitImageFuncPtrs (which is just XInitImage without the
sanity checking) makes gs start working.  But of course
_XInitImageFuncPtrs is not a public interface function and thus probably
not the best fix.  Replacing the &quot;bytes_per_line = raster&quot; with
&quot;bytes_per_line = 0&quot; (which makes X compute the value from width and
depth) works fine in the zoom levels that would otherwise crash but
causes the previously-working zoom levels to shear the image (or worse),
presumably because the &quot;obvious&quot; raster is not the right one at those
levels.

Also, the new XInitImage also requires bitmap_pad be set always.

The patch below also fixes the problem -- I can run &quot;gv pprof.ps&quot; at all
zoom levels, and I can also zoom into regular documents.

Perhaps it is not the right fix -- perhaps the actual bug is that
x_copy_image is being called with a bad raster value in the first place.
But it does work.</pre>

Fix (pdfwrite): Excessive redefinitions of CIDFonts causing memory exhaustion

Details:
bug #690642: &quot;conversion to PDF aborts after 800 pages&quot;

When instantiating a CIDFont with TrueType outlines, the TrueType interpretation code
tries to name the font using the name table from the TrueType font. If there is no name
table (as is the case for CIDFonts with TT outlines) it instead uses the XUID as the
name.

The XUID is incremented on every use, this means that each time the font is instantiated
(up to once per page when the job is PDF) we create a new CIDFont with a new name.
pdfwrite is unable to determine that these are all in fact the same original font, and
creates many fonts in the output file, eventually leading to memory exhaustion.

This change creates a new key in the current dictionary '/PDFCIDFontName', while
processing a CIDFont with TrueType outlines for a PDF file, which is the same as the
CIDFont BaseFont name. Since PDF can only have one descendant font per CIDFont this
should not cause name collisions. To avoid interference with PostScript the key is
removed from the current dictionary after use.

In the TrueType interpreter, if we are handling a CIDRFont then after loading the TT
tables we check to see if /PDFCIDFontName is defined. If it is we use it to replace the
/FontName and /CIFontName values. This means we only ever create the font with a single
name, which avoids the confusion with pdfwrite.

With this change pdfwrite only emits a single font and, usefully, it has the same name
as the font in the original PDF file.

<pre>
Add bounds checking to various icclib functions.

Based on a set of patches by Jan Lieskovsky at Red Hat,
addressing CVE-2009-0583 and CVE-2009-0792.

Details:

Various _get_size and _write methods in icclib 2.01 were vulnerable to
integer overflow from corrupt or malicious profile data. This commit
makes a number of changes to address this.

First, it enforces bounds checking on array indicies generated through
tag data lookup or floating point calculations, either throwing an error
or clamping, depending on the context.

Second, it converts a number of malloc(nelement*size) calls into
calloc(nelements, size), passing responsibility for overflow control
to the standard library. This works on recent glibc, MacOS 10.4 (at
least) and MSVC 2005 (at least; I believe MSVC 6 doesn't check for
overflow). Systems which overcommit memory allocations generally also
lazily zero pages, so the performance implications of an overflow in
calloc() resulting in a huge allocation (or the same happening at the
request of corrupt or malicious ICC profile data) are not as bad as
might appear relative to the original malloc(). From the other side,
multi-processing systems must often zero pages delivered to malloc
anyway to prevent information leakage.

On top of Jan's patches, this commit uses a fallback for SIZE_MAX, a
stdint.h define which isn't available on all platforms (notably MSVC),
and changes a number error message to match the malloc-&gt;calloc changes.

It fixes a serious bug where the new error checking code incorrectly
rejected valid profiles with an MLUT but no black point tag.
icc_get_luobj() always tried to load the black point tag, and if it
wasn't found, icc_read_tag() would set an error flag, which was later
picked up in icmLut_read() by the check added for the results of
icmLut_get_size(). Since the black point tag is optional, and icclib
already substitutes a default (0,0,0) black point if none is contained
in the profile, we just reset the error condition within
icc_get_luobj(). vtm2k.pdf is a good testfile for this issue.

Likewise, the length of lookup tables was limited to 100 points, as a 
resource consumption constraint, but the spec allows LUTs with up
to 255 points. Bug690495.pdf from the regression suite triggered
this problem.

Thanks to Michael Vrhel for these last two fixes.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Incorrect table in /Unicode /Decoding Resource

Details
Bug #690648 &quot;many incorrectly encoded Latin Extended-A characters&quot;

The job in this issue contains a subset incrementally downloaded TrueType font where
the Encoding is such that the first glyph encountered is encoded at character
position 1, the second at position two and so on. In addition there is no
GlyphNames2Unicode dictionary.

pdfwrite tries, whenever possible, to write a ToUnicode CMap into the output PDF file
which allows Acrobat and other consumers to copy and paste text using Unicode values.
Since there is no Unicode information in the file, and the Encoding is distinctly 
non-standard, we fall all the way back to using the glyph names as a last ditch
attempt to generate the Unicode information.

This relies on the /Unicode /decoding resource, it seems that many glyphs in this
resource were (and possibly still may be) encoded at the wrong Unicode code points. 
This patch fixes the glyphs raised in the bug report, there may be others.

The commits provides proper transparency support for fills with patterns that contain transparency. This is a merge of the pattern_trans branch into the trunk. 

DETAILS:

When a pattern contains a transparency, it should be blended with the underlying objects according to the current extended graphic state settings (e.g. knockout, blend mode etc).  Prior to this commit, patterns with transparency behaved always as knockout fills.  This fixes Bug 690467 and fixes issues for files that contain transparency patterns in the regression suite when using the pbm output device.
When a transparency is present in a pattern, a pdf14 device is pushed.  Pattern accumulation will then occur in the transparency buffer.  When the accumulation completes, the buffer that is created is no longer passed to the pattern tile object gx_pattern_trans_t through pdf14_put_image, but instead the buffer and various details about the buffer are placed in the existing planar form into a new member of gx_pattern_trans_t called ttrans.  
When a  path is to be filled with the pattern, we will be in pdf14_fill_path.  If the color to fill with is of type pattern1_color, then we will do a call to pdf14_tile_pattern_fill which pushes a transparency group the size of the path that we are filling, in the base color space of the tile.  We decompose the path to a rectangle list which is then filled using gx_trans_pattern_fill_rect.  If the fill is simple, i.e. if the tile step size and tile size are the same, then a straight forward non-overlapping fill of the rectangle occurs.  Otherwise a more complex filling occurs where the tiles may overlap.  If the tiles overlap, then blending will need to occur.  Optimizations were implemented to avoid blending if it is not required.  In addition, memcpy was used for the inner loop filling (rows) when dealing with the non overlapped case.  Going from planar data in the tile buffer to planar data in the transparency group that we are filling is much more efficient then switching between planar to chunky and back to planar like we would have had to do if we had used pdf14_put_image and stored the tile data in the buffer that is used for the nontransparency case.  Once the fill completes, the transparency group is popped, which will perform the appropriate blending with the parent group in the proper color space.
Currently it is not allowed to have the transparency tile stored as a clist.  Instead the tile is always stored in the ttrans object.  It would probably be worthwhile to fix this at some point.  When we are doing clist processing, code was added to write  (gx_dc_pattern_trans_write_raster) and read (gx_dc_pattern_read_trans_buff) the ttrans object to and from the clist.

Enhancement (pdfwrite) : Add a new switch 'PDFACompatibilityPolicy to control PDF/A
creation when encountering invalid content.

Details
Bug #690500 &quot;gs 8.63. Option dPDFA generating no pdf/a compliant files because of F
key.&quot; 

In the reported issue the input PDF file contains a Link annotation with no /F (Flags)
key defined. PDF/A states that only annotations with the 'Print' bit of the Flags field
are permitted. pdfwrite was emitting the annotation, thus creating an invalid PDF/A
file.

The new switch PDFCompatibilityPolicy allows the user to select the behaviour for these
kinds of events. The value defaults to 0, where the behaviour matches Acrobat, the file
is created, but is not PDF/A compliant, a warning to this effect is given. When set to
1, the content will be omitted, resulting in a compliant PDF/A file, a warning is
given for each piece of omitted content. Values other than 0 or 1 are treated as 0 and
a warning is given that the value is not understood.

Currently only implemented for annotations, it is expected this will be extended over
time.

It is the responsibility of creators of PDF's to not embed fonts that

respects the TrueType FSType FontInfo.

The copyright and license of fonts and ICC profiles in a PDF will

(or many other tools) to extract this information. We provide this
utility mostly to provide the 'source' for GPL'ed fonts as required

of 'source', so this lets users get the source and (using a font
editor) modify the font. See bug 690533 (if you must).

This patch is a continuation of revision 9842, to derive the fill
adjustment parameter from the graphics state and not assume the value
is 1/2.  Interestingly, the patch seems to result in improvements for
postscript in several regression test files.  For example cet file
13-13.ps page 3 appears to improve the clipping of the large (W)
character.  Previously the (W) character obscured the line on the top
border of the page, now the line is visible.  Unfortunately the non
banded result is still wrong and with the fix does not match the
banded output.  Analysis of this issue is incomplete and ongoing.

Fix (CID fonts): The fallback when totally failing to find a character code in a CMap
sets the CID to 0 (/.notdef) but failed to select a descendant font.

Details:
bug #690372 &quot;Error: /undefined in %Type0BuildGlyph&quot;

The PDF file is fundamentally flawed, the font uses the /Identity-H CMap for a font, but
the font uses single bytes for each character code, where the CMap expects 2 bytes for
every character code.

The font code falls back to using CID 0 (the /.notdef equivalent), but failed to select
a descendant font before returning. Because no descendant was selected GS was attempting
to extract the glyph from the type 0 font, which has no glyphs, and therefore failed 
with an undefined error.

The code has been modified to select a descendant font before continuing under these 
conditions.

Bug 690519 detected with pkmraw during regression testing.

DETAILS:

If a GC was run during a pattern accum in the PS interpreter, the pgs-&gt;dev_color
structure could be moved. This was not tracked, probably because the dev_color
was assumed to be &quot;dynamic&quot;. The fix performs gx_unset_dev_color during the
pattern_paint_cleanup (in zpcolor.c). This minimal change is all that is needed
since only the PS interpreter runs a &quot;real&quot; GC that moves structures.

Enhancement (TrueType fonts): Add support for Adobe's use of Identity CMap in PDF files,
when substituting a TrueType font, mapped as a CIDFont from disk, for a missing CIDFont.

Details:
bug #688515 &quot;Need method to map CIDFonts to TrueType fonts when Ordering is Identity&quot;
This issue also covers issues #689499, #688813, #689623 and #690483. 

When using a native TrueType font from disk as a replacement for a CIDFont, GS needs a
way to convert the character code used in the input file (either PostScript or PDF) into
a TrueType glyph ID (GID). 

When the TrueType font is declared (in cidfmap), the CSI entry contains an Ordering, this is concatenated with the CMAP declared in the actual TrueType font. This
information is used to create a CIDDecoding resource, certain  combinations (defined in
.CMapChooser) create CIDDecoding resources 'on the fly'.

A CIDDecoding resource simply maps a character code directly to a GID. Normally this
resource, when automatically created, is manufactured by converting the character code
to an internal code (using the declared CMap from cidfmap) and then converting the 
internal code to a GID using the TrueType CMAP table. Most often the internal code
is a Unicode code point.

The investigation in 688515 makes it clear that when we have an Identity CMap in a
PDF file the character code should be treated as the GID. This makes it very easy for 
us to construct a CIDDecoding resource, its a simple one-to-one. Unfortunately the 
existing machinery relies upon a CMap, and there is already a mapping for 
Identity.Symbol (An Identity CMap with a font whose CMAP table is a Symbol table).
We don't want to break this existing functionality, so the new code adds an entry
in .CMapChooser for Identity.Unicode (only to avoid errors) and then in the 
function which actually loads the TT font (load_sfnts in gs_cidtt.ps) we check
specifically for an Identity.Unicode Decoding. If we find one then we call a new
routine to create an Identity mapping (CIDMap) from character code to GID.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Make type 3 bitmap font text-searchable if possible

Details
Bug #690430 &quot;PCL to PDF creates non-searchable text with incorrect font bbox&quot;

There were several changes which needed to be made here, in particular

1) Prevent the PDF text routines updating the text state when using type 3 bitmap
   fonts, as this caused each glyph to be emitted individually.

2) Change the way bitmap glyphs are recorded and drawn, previously each glyph origin
   was the top of the glyph, which meant that different height glyphs had effectively
   differing baselines. The need to shift y position caused glyphs to appear on 
   different PDF 'lines', which prevented searching

3) Hone some internal heuristics which prevented large kerning values and caused glyphs 
   to be placed individually.

Fix (pdfwrite): Bug in pdfmark processing

Bug #690525 &quot;hyperlinks in pdf off by one page since revision 9779&quot;

Revision 9779 fixed a problem when a DOCVIEW pdfmark did not specify a /Page or View to

invalid xref to be created.

This was fixed by altering the page count, but this caused real DEST pdfmarks not to

Restored the page count, and used the presence of either a /Page or /View pdfmark to
generate a page number, if neither is present no page number is created. This fixes
both issues.

Previously we identified a banding device by checking if its
get_bits_rectangle procedure was the same as the procedure used in the
constant procedure declarations gs_clist_device_procs.  This
conditional has not been correct since the multi-threaded code, the
get_bits_rectangle() procedure is overridden with a new procedure
get_bits_rectangle_mt() and all devices were detected as non-banding.
We change the procedure checked to be open_device and don't expect
this to be overridden, but the code is still somewhat awkward.

The broken conditional resulted in non deterministic behavior in the
wtsimdi device, indirectly causing the complexity array to be
uninitialized.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Bug with DOCVIEW pdfmark handling

Details
bug #690514 &quot;PageMode DOCVIEW pdfmarks result in broken PDF file&quot;

Using the the /PageMode DOCVIEW pdfmark without using another DOCVIEW pdfmark
which directly references a page (eg specifying the page to open on via /Page)
results in a spurious extra entry in the xref table, referencing the first page
object.

This is caused by the pdfwrite routine 'pdfmark_make_dest' which calls
'pdfmark_page_number'. If there is no specified /Page in the pdfmark, then a new
page reference for the 'next' page is allocated in the xref table, using the
location of the current page. This is the source of the spurious entry.

Note that the DOCVIEW code seems to assume that there be at most one /Page or /View
pdfmark in the array.

Fixed by decrementing the page count in pdfmark_page_number if the string being
parsed for a page number is empty.

Fix (colour handling): improper handling of ICCBased space with a /Alternate ICCBased
    space

Details:
bug #690495 &quot;Error: /typecheck in --@0x1007f6f0--&quot;

It is technically possible (apparently) for a PDF file to contain an ICCBased space
which has an /Alternate space which is also an ICCBased space. The existing
validation code assumed this would not be the case and reused a reference if the
latter space had no /Alternate in order to select an appropriate final Alternate.

This led to the latter ICCBased space being replaced by the selected default space,
which meant we had fewer spaces than expected when actually setting the space.

Fixed by inserting the selected appropriate default space into the ICC dictionary as
an /Alternate and revalidating the modified space.

Fix an uninitialized variable warning in FAPI_do_char.

Details:

Previously the local variable 'code' was used for incidental return 
value checks, but *also* to set cr.is_glyph_index in in the CID font 
case. This is because cid_to_TT_charcode() returns 1 on success, but
if it can't find a character code for the given cid, it sets the
character code to zero and returns zero itself to indicate failure.

Zero makes more sense as a glyph id (.notdef) than as a character
code, so in this case it's appropriate to set is_glyph_index based
on this. The other paths which set 'code' all deal with truetype
fonts, so the default success value of zero is also correct.

However, there were in theory code paths where code was never set,
and so is_glyph_index was being set from an unitialized value; thus
the gcc warning. And the double-use of the variable 'code' was hard
to read. This commit adds a separate boolean to track whether we've
found a character code or not and sets cr.is_glyph_index based on
that.

Fix (FAPI) : Type 2 fonts with local Subrs fail

Details
Type 2 (CFF) fonts may have both local and global subroutines. Normally fonts will only
contain a global set, while FontSet fonts may contain both a global set, and a local set
per font.

The FAPI code, when converting an internal GS representation back into a CFF stream,
incorrectly conflated the local and global Subrs into a single GSubrs (global subrs)
dict. Additionally it pushed the local subrs first. The result of this is that glyphs
using a callgsubr operator retrieved the subroutine, and glyphs using a callsubr would
fail because no local Subrs were defined.

Extended the FAPI code to retrieve the local and global subrs separately, to write a
local /Subrs dict if required, and to correctly calculate the /Subrs offset and store
it in the font Private dict when a /Subrs dict is present.

The real issue is that the drag-and-drop interface had a fixed buffer of 80

It looks like the original code was from some boiler plate sample. Updated the code
to use the DragQeryFiles API call to find the length of the full path specification
and then malloc a buffer to hold it. Although we would never normally use the system
malloc call, this should not be a problem in the Windows-specific code.

Fix (FAPI) : FAPI fails when FontBBox is missing

we should inherit the FontBBox from the FontDescriptor in the PDF file, but we don't
have a mechanism to do that. 

Since PDF isn't a programming language the scope for using the FontBBox is pretty
limited, so for now I've chosen to ignore the error.

When the blending color space for the soft mask is not specified, the blending color space is set to UNKNOWN.  This is later resolved when the compositor action is handled.  In this case, the parents color space or the device color space is used for blending.  The code was in place

Fix (FAPI): Incremental Type 42 font with GlyphDirectory &amp; missing glyphs fails

Details
The FAPI code assumed that the routine to extract glyph data from sfnts would always
work when a GlyphDirectory is present, and used glyf + loca if this routine failed, 
assuming that this meant there was no GlyphDirectory. However, the test file
Bug687845.ps contains a type 42 incrementally downloaded font which uses a
GlyphDirectory and also attempts to access glyphs which aren't defined in the
GlyphDirectory.

This caused the code to try and use the loca and glyf tables, which aren't present,
which caused an error.

Modified the FAPI code to return a glyph length of 0 when we have a GlyphDirectory but
no defined glyph. This causes GS to render nothing, which matches the regular result as
well as the action of Acrobat.

Fix (FAPI) : FAPI fails when FontBBox is a packed array

Details
The FPAI code attempts to modify the FontBBox in the font dictionary after rebuilding a
font with a non-GS font renderer. However it assumed that the FontBBox would always be a regular array, capable of handling real numbers.

Some fonts have FontBBox arrays which only contain small integers, and which are 
therefore stored as packed arrays (t_shortarray in GS). This was cuasing the FAPI code
to throw an error.

Modified the code to replace the packed array with a full array before filling in the
new values, if the original array was packed.

Replace malloc with gs_alloc_bytes in the inferno device.

Details:

The inferno device allocates an image writer struct in initwriteimage,

We prefer to use gs_alloc_bytes instead of calling system malloc
because it respects memory contraints requested by the client. Note
however that the w pointer is local to inferno_print_page and not
traceable. This is fine and the structure doesn't have a lifetime
outside that function. If it did, it would need to be stored and
enumerated in inferno_device.

a memory pool pointer.</pre>

Enahncement (FAPI) : Allow FAPI to work with pdfwrite.

DETAILS :

FreeType could not be used with pdfwrite for any purpose, even to render
fonts for bitmap fallback. This seems overly pessimistic. 

This patch allows FAPI font rendering engines to work with pdfwrite, this 
will mean the FAPI interface is used for the selected types of font (see 
FAPI for documentation) including CharString decoding and especially 
rendering to bitmaps for type 3 font fallback.

In general pdfwrite uses its own routines to write and convert font types as
required, but it does not render any kind of font data, so if it is unable
to handle a font type it relies on the graphics library to render the glyph
to a bitmap, which is then stored in a type 3 font.

The FAPI code checks the device parameters to see if 'EmbedFontObjects' is 
true, and does not attempt to use the FAPI for fonts if it is. So firstly we
alter the device parameters in pdfwrite to set this to false.

The FAPI code was assuming that the text enumerator it received would always
be a 'show' enumerator, and extracted a pointer to the graphics state from it.
Of course if the device is pdfwrite then the text enumerator will instead be 
a pdf_text_enum. Modified the code to check the object type of the enumerator
and use the pointer to the imager state (checking it is a st_gs_state type)
if this is not a show enumerator. Also only update the 'cc' fields in the 
enumerator if this is a show enumerator.

Note that because the CharString and font validation is handled by the font
rendering engine, it may differ from the GS engine regarding the validity
of fonts.

This is a merge of the smask_work branch into the trunk.  The merge fixes issues related to missing soft masks, improperly rendered soft masks and transparency group color spaces.  It addresses a number of bugs including 688728 689422 689512 689931 688601 689968 690958 690115 690157 and 690170.    

DETAILS:
This commit is a compilation of changes that occurred in the smask_work SVN branch.  That branch was created with rev 9134 on Oct 8 2008.  The final commit to that branch was with rev.  9665.  For extreme details on the changes in this commit, you can review the commit messages within that branch.
Soft masks:  The basic architecture for the soft mask remains in place; where by the soft mask is composed with the popping of the transparency group.  In performing soft mask operations, the current code pushes a soft mask, which creates a new buffer.  This buffer is then rendered into.  Once the soft mask drawing is completed, the soft mask is popped.  This operation moves the soft mask buffer into the mask buffer of the parent transparency group.  When that transparency group is popped, it should be composed with its parent layer, while being adjusted with the soft mask buffer values.  If there was never a transparency group that was popped following the soft mask, then the soft mask would not be applied.  The solution to this issue involved changes in pdfdraw.ps that forced the creation of a transparency group when one had not yet been created if a soft mask push was to occur.  When this extra group is popped, the soft mask will then be applied.  The PDF interpreter knows that a SMask exists in the ExtGstate when 'SoftMask' is not null. Since the ExtGState elements are part of the top dict, the 'begin' .. 'end'  part of the 'q' and 'Q' operators, respectively, take care of keeping the SoftMask current.  When a transparency group is executed, the SoftMask is set to null since the SMask saved in the pdf14 'maskbuf' element will be applied during the blending when the transparency group is popped.
Soft masks are now drawn in the specified group color space.  Previously, the soft mask was drawn in the target device color space and then the K channel for the CMYK case or the R channel for the RGB case were used as the soft mask luminance channel.   Now the mapping from the DeviceRGB or DeviceCMYK to a luminance component is performed as specified by the PDF specification.  If the color space is CIE based, the base device space is used.  This CIE case does not follow the PDF specification but does follow what occurs with Acrobat Reader.    Previously the code carried around the soft mask buffer as an RGB or CMYK buffer.  It is now represented by a gray buffer.
Transparency groups: Color space changes for transparency groups are now followed.  Previously, the target device color space was always used for blending.  Now the proper color space is used, with the exception of ICC and other CIE based spaces.  For those spaces the base device color space is used.  The ICC and CIE based spaces will be addressed when the ICC branch is merged.  Changing the current code to do forward and backward mappings with the ICC color spaces is beyond the work scope of the smask_work branch.    In the presence of nested transparency groups, the parent color space can be different than the child color space.  When the child is popped, its contents are now converted from the child’s color space to the parent’s color space.  Note that if the output device is a separation device, the transparency group color space is ignored and the blending is performed amongst the channels, which can be numerous if there are many spot colors.  Also note that for soft mask groups, the alternate tint transform is always used for spot colors.
To achieve these fixes, a number of changes besides those already mentioned above were required.  These include:
A dynamic update of the pdf14 device colorinfo value based upon the color space of the current transparency group.  This information is used often in deciding how to encode and decode the color data.  In the case of the clist writer and reader, the code often ends up forwarding certain operations to the target device in which case we no longer would have the colorinfo of the pdf14 device.  The solutions to this problem required the addition of a clist_color_info member value to the clist writer device.  This value is updated in the same manner that the pdf14 device will be updated during the clist reader phase thereby ensuring the proper color information is written and read.  Also required was the addition of a trans_device item to the imager state.  This was needed due to the fact that the clist writer forwards its fill path command to the target device.  In the shading code, if we have a DeviceN color space we eventually get back to pdf14_cmap functions, assuming we have a RGB or CMYK target device.  These cmap functions should make use of the clist device to map to the proper blending color space NOT the target device color space.  In the current code, the cmap functions can only see the target device and the imager state hence the solution to add trans_device to the imager state.  This is only used during clist writing and assigned during the clist writers PDF14 fill path at which point it is assigned the address of the clist writer device.  During the PDF14 cmap functions, if the trans_device is not NULL in the imager state we use that device's color mapping procs instead of the target device color mapping procs.  In this approach, we maintain access to the transparency group color space and its procedures through the imager state.  Finally, shading fills should NOT occur in the device color space when we are within a transparency group with a different color space.  To avoid this issue a boolean named has_transparency was added to the imager state.  Now if we find that we are in a transparency group during the shading fills, then the is_linear_color_applicable operation will return a false and the target color space is not used for blending.
To maintain the changing pdf14 color space information in the presence of nested groups, parent_color_info_procs was added to the already nested pdf14_buf_s where the new pdf14_parent_color_t contains the information related to the parent’s color space.   This handles the nesting of color information for the clist reader.  For the clist writer, pdf14buf is always NULL.  For this case, a pointer to a pdf14_parent_t was added to pdf14_device_s.  A stack was created and the color information is pushed on and popped off the stack as the transparency groups are pushed and popped during the clist writer phase.  
Changes were also required in pdfdraw.ps to handle the case when a transparency group does NOT define a color space.  In this case, the parent’s group color space (or the target device color space if we are at the first level) should be used.
In the presence of a monochrome target device, the previous code PDF14 device was still pushing an RGB buffer initially.  This is now changed and a monochrome buffer is created. 
There was much confusion in the code relating to the number of colors, separations, spot colors, and process colors.  This became clear when looking at a file that had over 100 colorants. GX_DEVICE_COLOR_MAX_COMPONENTS defines the max number of different colors that we currently encode.  This should include both the process colors and the spot colors.  Many parts of the code looked at these colors differently. Some portions of the code treated the number of spot colors and/or separations as having a range to GX_DEVICE_COLOR_MAX_COMPONENTS, while other parts include the process color AND the spot colors in that range.   The changes here ensure that GX_DEVICE_COLOR_MAX_COMPONENTS defines the max number for all process and spot colors.  
The current code did not recognize patterns with transparency in PDF.  Now, the presence of transparency in a pattern is detected.  If a transparency component is found, the pdf14 compositor is installed.    
Finally, pdf_draw.ps was modified so that when an image is encountered with a softmask (/doimagesmask) AND the output device is pdfwrite then we do avoid the DoImage that is used to fill the softmask buffer for the pdf14 device.  The pdfwrite device will obtain the maskdata as part of image3x.  Previously, the mask image was at times being placed in-line for the pdfwrite device during the DoImage that is associated with storing the softmask buffer in the pdf14device.  In the old flow, the SMask image was effectively being processed twice.

Fix (colour) : Ensure /UseCIEColor sets for initial space correctly.

Details
bug #690432 &quot;/UseCIEColor not working with default colour space&quot;

The change to process colour and colour space in C instead of in PostScript overlooked 
code in gs_setpd.ps  which interacts badly with an optimisation.

The optimisation skips changing colour space if its the same as the current space. But
if /UseCIEColor has changed value we must not skip the change. This was achieved 
previously by only skipping the change if UseCIEColor was false, and setting the space
to something other than DeviceGray in gs_setpd.ps.

We take advantage of the same trickery by always setting the space to something other
than DeviceGray in gs_setpd.ps, in the knowledge that initgraphics will switch the 
current space back to DeviceGray. Because the spaces don't match we will process the
change, getting the correct result for UseCIEColor.

Fix (pdfwrite) : Work aroung wrong numGlyphs.

DETAILS :
Patch and log supplied by Leonardo.

Bug 690047 &quot;Incorrect cmap generated by pdfwrite&quot;.

If a source True Type font defines numGlyphs lesser then
the actually defined number of glyphs,
the old code writes an incorrect True Type header with
wrong offsets to subtables.

Since in nowadays the number of glyphs may be increased
due to font merging, we decided to write the extended subtables
with a bigger number of glyphs. See comments in code.
See enlarged_numGlyphs and related code portions.
The original numGlyphs is kept unchanged for easier debugging.

For an easier debugging added checks into psf_write_truetype_data
for comparing actual subtable offsets with ones written
into the True Type header. The new structure subtable_positions
works for that.

Also improved a printing in gs_type42_font_init.
The old code can print occasional garbage beyond the font name end.

Fix (ps2epsi): rounding problems calculating bbox.

Details:
Bug #688500 &quot;ps2epsi produces too-narrow bounding box (2)&quot;.

Text and linework rendered at low resolution can differ by a few pixels from
that rendered at higher resolution because of serifs, miters etc. The ps2epsi 
script rendered the job at low resolution and used that both to calculate the 
bounding box, as well as for the epsi preview. This could lead to small errors 
if the job was re-rendered at a higher resolution

The new approach is to use the bbox device in Ghostscript to calculate a more
accurate bounding box. This has meant altering the scripts for all the
operating systems.

Also, the ps2epsi.bat file did not work correctly under Windows Vista. A
new 'cat.ps' file has been added to gs/lib. This uses the %infile% and
%outfile% environment variables and concatenates the two files together.

The PCL file consists of a single large image covering the page. However,
the PCL interpreter calls 'process_zero_rows' (rtraster.c) which has the
side effect (sometimes at least) of closing the image and restarting it.

Pdfwrite already has code to handle a short image like this, it replaces
the image dictionary /Height value with the number of rows of data
actually received. However, if subsampling is enabled, this can be
incorrect, some of the rows of received data may have been discarded.

of data received by the subsample factor before storing as the new /Height.

Enhancement (pdfwrite) : Allow pdfwrite to produce multiple copies of pages. New flag
        'DoNumCopies' added.

Details
Bug #690355 : &quot;pdfwrite ignores the &quot;#copies&quot; setting in PostScript input&quot;

The pdfwrite device follows the behaviour of Acrobat Distiller and ignores the /#copies
and /NumCopies settings in PostScript. This is at least partly because these can't be
expected to work properly with Destination annotations specifying a page as the
destination (eg Link or Outline annotations).

However CUPS (and potentially other PDF workflow applications) may have no way of
determining that application-produced PostScript requires multiple copies to be 
printed, after the file has been converted to PDF.

For the benefit of such applications a new flag 'DoNumCopies' has been added, if 
present then pdfwrite will duplicate each page in the output as many times as the 
/#copies or /NumCopies current setting.

There is currently no provision for reordering the pages, the duplicates follow the 
original immediately in page order.

Fix (pdfwrite): Incorrect handling of type 1 counter control hints.

Details:
bug #690349 &quot;corrupt PDF is generated out of PostScript-file with asian fonts&quot;

When converting type 1 outlines to type 2 outlines, we were not catering for
OtherSubrs 12 or 13 (counter control hints) in the first pass over the font.
These operators take a large number of arguments, and these were being left 
on the font operand stack. This quickly resulted in a stack overflow and an 
invalidfont error. We now remove the operands from the stack when we encounter 
them.

In addition, the code for writing CIDFontType0 fonts which called the conversion
routine was not checking the return value, and carried on trying to embed the font
anyway.

Details
Flagged by Coverity, the FAPI code used op_show_find to get the text enumerator, but
did not check the return value, which can be NULL for a failure. Later the enumerator
is dereferenced, potentially causing a crash. This is actually almost certainly
impossible since this is a finish routine and the enumerator is known to have existed
previously, but its good to be safe.

Fix (pdfwrite) : NeverEmbed/AlwaysEmbed not working properly.

DETAILS :

Patch and Log supplied by Leonardo.

Bug 689610 &quot;Possible /NeverEmbed vs /AlwaysEmbed problem&quot;
The root of the problem is that (1) empty arrays did not work,
and (2) existing values of the parameters (before setdistillerparams)
were not properly accounted for in setdistillerparams.


In the old code, PS and C parts of &quot;embed&quot; parameters implementation
are inconsistent each to another and to the documentation. Replacing both with the
right logic defined in the Adobe Distiller Parameters specification.
The comment in gdevpsdp.c line 81 is kept as the basic interface definition.

Note: in the old code param_read_embed_array could not distinguish empty array from
no array,  but it is important for the Adobe logic.
Also psdf_put_embed_param parameters did not correspond  to the documentation in
gdevpsdp.c ln 81.

A better fix would be subsetting EBDT, EBLC, EBSC

Also it will be necessary to compact the glyph index space

Fix (fonts): PaintType 2 fonts not working.

Details:
bug #689826 &quot;FT_BRIDGE crashes with CID fonts&quot;

The initial problem is that a required table, TT_cmap, was NULL, and was not tested
by the CID decoding module before attempting to use it.

Further investigation revealed a fair number of problems surrounding this are. The 
problems stem from the use of a native TrueType font on disk to replace a CIDFont (not 
from an actual CIDFont as the summary suggests). When using a CIDFont the character
code is mapped to a CID using the CMap and the CID is directly used to extract the 
glyph program from the font's CharStrings dictionary.

With a TrueType font that is not sufficient, TrueType fonts use Glyph IDs (GID) and
have a completely different method of mapping the encodings. We attempt to handle this
by converting the CID to a Unicode value, and then use the TT Unicode CMAP subtable to
convert the Unicode value to a GID.

With GS' own font handling this works, because we extract the CMAP subtable and carry
it around in the font. WHen using FreeType this is not done, and so the conversion
fails.

Modified the FAPI interface to create a new method 'check_cmap_for_glyph' which will
allow us to interrogate the TT CMAP subtable from the FAPI server. Copied sections of
CID decoding from zcid.c to zfapi.c in order to perform the same checks as our own 
code and use the correct Unicode value.

The FAPI code seems to assume that it will always get an 'e_limitcheck' error when no

the case when the font is intended to be an outline. In this case there is no raster, 
but the error return is not e_limitcheck.

Rather than rely on an error value, modified the code so that if the font has a

Following Adobe implementation, copy only a few top elements of the stack
to the corresponding element of the $error dictionary when the stack
overflows. Adobe copies up to 500 top elements, we copy up to 65535. This
feature enables Ghostscript to have maximum stack sizes larger than 65535.
The maximum operand stack size is set to 100000 to match Adobe interpreters.
The large stack size is needed for some PDF files that construct large
dictionaries using &lt;&lt; ... &gt;&gt; operators. Bug 690307, customer 850.

Look for the 'cmap' table in the font dictionary and use it when mapping
a cid to a character code when using the FAPI bridge.

This replaces a segfault with an invalid font error. Bug 689826.

Details:

This clause in FAPI_do_char() was explicitly calling
cid_to_TT_charcode() with a NULL TT_cmap argument, which that function
dereferenced, causing a segfault. As far as Ken and I can tell, that
function can't do anything useful without the cmap table from the
underlying font, so it makes the most sense the resolve the segfault
this way.

However, the ps library code doesn't set this key in the font
dictionary, so for now this just replaces the segfault with an
/invalidfont in --.FAPIBuildGlyph-- error. We could continue
silently by ignoring the mapping if the cmap isn't available down
in TT_char_code_from_CID_no_subst() in which case that font just
would not render as part of the document. We expect to fix this on
the postscript side, so I felt this was a better course for now.</pre>

Fix (colour): Faulty error handling

Details:
bug #690312 &quot;gs stalls, never returns on attached figure&quot;

The job causes the 'base' (Gray, RGB, CMYK) colour code to be executed with a completely
full stack, which causes a stackoverflow because this routine needs to push the colour
space name onto the operand stack.

However, the operand stack wasn't being checked until after the continuation procedure 
had been pushed onto the execution stack, so after the error handling, we returned to
the continuation procedure, but without an appropriate operand stack. This caused a
loop to run without bounds.

Fixed by checking the operand stack beforesetting up the execution stack for the
continuation and aborting if it is full. Desk checking revealed another potential case
of the same problem, fixed in the same patch.

Change the maxval value for pkm and pkmraw files from 1 to 255.

Details:

Some programs (notably Adobe Photoshop through at least CS4) do not
correctly read PPM files that have a maxval!=255, displaying them
as all black (technically not entirely black, but with pixels set
to 0 or 1).  

This change causes Ghostscript to set maxval to 255 and scale the
output bitmap to 0..255.  Because PBM doesn't pack pixels in the
PPM raw format the output file size will not change; PPM files will
up to double in size (previously each pixel used 6 bytes, &quot;1 1 1 &quot;,
now each pixel uses up to 12 bytes, &quot;255 255 255 &quot;).

<pre>
Replace the hardcoded reference to the FreeType library subpaths with a
more direct specification of compile and link flags.

The msvc build is untested.

Details:

Previously, the top level makefile was supposed to define a path to the
freetype source directory, along with the platform-specific library
filename extension. From this the ft bridge makefile section generated
specific references for include paths and the library. This only worked
with a specific version of the library.

This commit removes the variable for passing the library extension,
and relies on the top-level makefile to provide the link commands,
passed in the FT_LIBS variable. Such link commands are generally
platform-specific anyway, so FT_LIB_EXT was redundant. Likewise,
the include path specifiers must be part of the FT_CFLAGS variable.

Previously, FT_LIBS was called FT_LIB. We generally use _LIB for a
single library name. Having the plural LIBS is more common for an
actual link command, which may include flags and other libraries
which are dependencies. This variable is used in the second way.

The build documentation is also updated to reflect the new scheme,
and mention the incremental font support, which seems to be disabled
in most builds.

Update freetype includes to the currently recommended scheme.

Details:

In freetype2, the recommended method of including the headers is to
include &lt;ft2build.h&gt;, depending on a -I line on the compiler's command
line to select the particular location for this, usually something like
$(INCLUDE_DIR)/freetype/

This header defines macros which expand to includes for particular
features, depending on how the particular freetype instance being
built is configured.

This means that we can't have explicit dependencies on the headers we
use, so those references are also removed. This has a side effect of
making it much easier to link with a system version of freetype.

However, the fapi_ft bridge requires freetype's incremental fonts
feature, which seems not to be enabled by default.

Fix (TrueType interpreter): Ignore a 'faulty font' condition

Details:
bug #689760 &quot;Missing characters: Failed to interpret TT instructions&quot;

The font in question is technically invalid. The problem occurs in function 1 of the
FPGM table:

	00069: PUSHB[2]              0    21 
	00072: JMPR       
	00073: ABS        
	00074: DUP        
	00075: ROLL       
	00076: RCVT       
	00077: DUP        
	00078: ROLL       
	00079: SUB        
	00080: ABS        
	00081: PUSHB[1]             50 
	00083: LT         
	00084: IF         
	00085: SWAP       
	00086: EIF        
	00087: POP        
	00088: ROUND[Black] 
	00089: PUSHB[1]             64 
	00091: MAX        
	00092: ENDF       

The JMPR (jump relative) instruction is intended to resume execution at the ENDF
instruction, but the number of bytes is miscounted, falling of the end of the function.
I suspect some TT interpreters catch this by spotting the fact that the IP is past the
end of the function.

We don't seem to be able to check if we've fallen off a function, because we don't store
function lengths, so this code works around the problem by checking the opcode after we
apply the JMPR but befopre resuming execution. If the opcode is *not* ENDF, but the 
preceding opcode was, assume that we have a counting problem, and move the IP back one
instruction.

Also applied the same work around to JROT and JROF instructions.

Fix (TrueType interpreter): Ignore a 'faulty font' error

Details:
bug #689471 &quot;Error in Processing Type42 Charstrings&quot;

The font in question is missing a glyph in the GLYF table, which is used 
as a component by a composite glyph. A later instruction then tries to access 
a non-existent point (probably defined in the missing component), which causes
an error.

FreeType 1 and 2 both ignore this error unless pedantic_hinting is set, other
TrueType interpreters behave similarly.

Modified the code in Ins_MIAP to ignore errors of this type, and continue.

Make the font cache determinstic.

Details:

Previously the font cache order was based on the value of the pair
pointer.  On some (most?) computers this resulted in the cache being
filled in a deterministic way but not on the the cluster used for
regression testing.  The cache fill order is important because it
affects which entries are removed when the cache is full which
matters because re-rendered glyphs can differ from the cached
rendering (a separate bug, 690281, has been opened for this issue).

Fixes bugs 690232 and 690233.

Fix (graphics library): Rotated/skewed text not anti-aliased

Details:
bug #688032 &quot;Rotated text is not antialiased.&quot;

A specific test in 'show_set_scale' disabled oversampling of text if it was
rotated or skewed. Testing indicates that anti-aliasing does provide some improvement 
in text, even when it is rotated or skewed, so this test has been removed.

Also removed the compile-time option to not cache rotated glyphs by removing the
#define CACHE_ROTATED_CHARS and the test against it in show_state_setup. This allowed
the removal of the routine 'is_matrix_good_for_caching'.

Protect some printf-like calls in the pcl3 output device from spurious
format specifiers. This eliminates a security-related gcc warning.

Details:

I believe the previous code was actually safe. However, this approach is
more robust. If any of the string buffers passed to errprintf() happened
to contain a format specifier (like %d) an out of bounds stack reference
could result.

This allows the default build to complete with -Werror=format-security,
which the Mandriva linux distribution is reported to be using.

The LastLine now defaults to the last line of the page (height-1). Bug 690217.
Thanks to Piotr Strzelczyk for spotting this.

DETAILS:

Note that this prevents output of a single line at the top (line 0), but this
was mostly just for testing to emulate custom devices that only call 'get_bits'
on less than all of the lines which had the potential to confuse the thread
lookahead prediction logic in the multi-threaded rendering case.

New feature (pswrite): Center pages on output, new switch -dCenterPages

Details:
bug #690100 &quot;Enhancement request: create centered output when reading PDF&quot;

Added a new switch to the collection of media handling controls supported by ps2write. The new CenterPages switch will center the output image on the media, regardless of the size of the media (if the output is larger than the media it will be truncated, but the image will still be centered on the media).

This switch is compatible with the RotatePages control, but not with SetPageSize or FitPages. Like the other switches it can be set as an argument to ps2write when creating a PostScript file (which fixes the result) or it can be supplied to the consuming interpreter in some fashion.

Updated ps2ps2.htm with the new details.

Fix (pdfwrite): Limit on CIDFont size too low

Details:
bug #688736 &quot;ps2pdf does not work on these files&quot;

The 'remaining' issue in these files is the 'error -15' problem. This is caused when writing out a subset CIDFont, and the subset grows to be a large font in its own right.

The way that CFF fonts are written, there is interaction between certain parts. The offset of various tables depends on the size of the Top Dict, but the Top Dict contains the offsets of the CharStrings and the CharSet, so its size is partially dependent on those offsets....

The code in psf_write_cid0_font() initially assigns large values (0x7fffff) to the offsets, then iterates over the data quickly converging on a suitable size of offset, which allows calculation of the Top Dict. 

The problem was that 0x7fffff was too small for the offset of the Font Dict, (which comes after the CharStrings) if the CharStrings table was very large (~8MB). While this is probably adequate in 'real life', because its unlikely a real job would contain so many different glyphs, it is simple to solve by increasing the original 'guess' from 0x7fffff to 0x1ffffff (~32MB), which should be enough for any font.
