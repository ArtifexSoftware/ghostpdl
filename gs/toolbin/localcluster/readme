How to setup a new computer to run regression jobs on the Artifex Cluster:

1.  Get limited access passwordless ssh to casper working:

    Move the included cluster_key file to your ~/.ssh directory.

    Verify that the permission of this file is 600.

    Choose a name for your machine, this has to be unique within the
    cluster (currently in use names are i7, i7a, imac, macpro, and peeves).

    Inform Marcos of the name so that he can add it to the list
    of machines allowed to send ssh commands to casper.

    After Marcos lets you know that your machine has been added you
    should be able to to run a very limited set of command on casper via
    ssh using the cluster_key without being asking for your password.
    To test this try (replacing your_machine_name with your previously
    chosen machine name):

      ssh -i ~/.ssh/cluster_key marcos@casper.ghostscript.com \
        touch /home/marcos/cluster/your_machine_name.done

    You can verify that an arbitrary command is not allowed by trying:

      ssh -i ~/.ssh/cluster_key marcos@casper.ghostscript.com \
        touch /home/marcos/cluster/your_machine_name.test

2.  Make a directory where the cluster software can live, the default
    location is cluster, which is where tar should have installed this
    file and the others included with it, but if you prefer this can be
    anywhere you like.  If you've chosen a different directory move the
    files from this directory to it and cd to it.

3.  Checkout the various test files and source code by executing the
    setup_cluster script.  You may already have copies of these files
    on your machine but I'd rather not support having them installed in
    other directories, so please just live with another copy.

    Note that this will take a while (2+ hours), though the time will
    vary based on what else casper is doing at the time and your
    internet connection speed.

4.  Modify the clusterpull.sh script by editing the line:

      set machine=REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_MACHINE_NAME

5.  Add the following to your crontab, this schedules the clusterpull.sh
    script run once every minute (you'll have to appropriately change
    the directory name):

    * * * * * cd /home/marcos/cluster ; ./clusterpull.sh

    Note that the clusterpull.sh script is fairly low impact, it sends
    a heartbeat signal to casper via 'ssh touch' and check to see if a
    job is ready to run by attempting to scp a file from casper.

6.  Viola!  Sit back, relax, and watch your cpu load climb to the roof
    the next time someone does a commit.

    Note that the cluster self-balances for load, the initial assumption
    is that the new node is of average speed (which is a 3.2 GHz i7).
    After each cluster run is completed the number of jobs assigned to
    each node is slowly adjusted based on the time it took to complete
    its jobs.

    Also, if a machine hasn't sent a heartbeat in a while (currently
    defined to be three minutes) it is assumed that machine is down
    and it won't be assigned any jobs.  If a machine goes down during
    a cluster run that will also be detected, all of the jobs will be
    aborted and a new run will be started with the machines that are
    up at that time.
