/* font structures for the PDF interpreter */

/* Fonts are, unfortunately, complicated by the fact that the graphics state font object
 * the 'gs_font' structure is not reference counted. The PostScript interpreter relies upon
 * the garbage collector to clean these up, but since we aren't using a garbage collector
 * we have to manage the lifetime of these ourselves.
 *
 * The complication is that the gs_font pointer is stored in the graphics state and there
 * is no simple mechanism to know when a font in a graphics state is no longer being used
 * (in the absence of a garbage collector). So what we do is use the 'client_data' member
 * of the gs_font structure to point to our font object, a pdf_font *, which itself
 * contains a pointer to the gs_font structure.
 *
 * On each pdfi_gsave() we look at the gs_font in the current graphics state (if any) and
 * use the client_data to find the corresponding pdf_font, we then cout that object up. On
 * each pdfi_grestore we again use the client_data to find our pdf_font object, and count
 * it down. The Tf operator replaces the gs_font in the current graphics state, and we count
 * the current one down, and the new one up, before replacing it.
 *
 * When the pdf_font object's reference count reaches 0 we can safely free the associated
 * gs_font structure. Note that the cache may still contain a reference to the pdf_font
 * object, so it may not be freed immediately it is no longer in use. This helps us avoid
 * too much redefinition of fonts.
 *
 * When we create a pdf_font object, we replace the cached object, which is a dictionary,
 * with the pdf_font object. So when we call pdfi_dereference() if we get back a pdf_font
 * object we know that this is an existing font (keyed by object number) and don't need to
 * rebuild it. If we get a pdf_dict object then we do need to build the graphics library
 * font.
 *
 * This still does leave the (admittedly remote) possibility of using a font in one graphics
 * state, gsave'ing, setting a new font, and then dereferencing enough objects to force the
 * original font out of the cache, then using that same font again. While there is no
 * obvious problem with that, it is inefficient. I think we can evade the problem by using
 * the next and prev pointers in the gs_fotn structure. If we keep the linked list correct
 * when creating and freeing fonts, we can walk the list of 'active' fonts, following
 * the clien_data pointer to get the pdf_font object, and checking its object number against
 * the one we are looking for. We only need to do this if the result of pdfi_derference()
 * Is a pdf_dict object. Obviously if we don't find an active font then we need to go
 * through the effort of creating one.
 *
 * FIXME - none of the above is yet implemented!
