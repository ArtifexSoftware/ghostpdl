# The "?=" style of this makefile is designed to facilitate "deriving"
# your own make file from it by setting your own custom options, then include'ing
# this file. In its current form, this file will compile using default options
# and locations. It is recommended that you make any modifications to settings
# in this file by creating your own makefile which includes this one.

# This file only defines the portions of the makefile that are different
# between the present language switcher vs. the standard pcl6 makefile which
# is included near the bottom. All other settings default to the base makefile.
