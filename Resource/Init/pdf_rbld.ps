% pdf_rbld.ps - Rebuilding of broken PDF files (xref errors)

% This module contains routines that are used if we detect an error
% while reading the xref tables.  These routines will scan the file and
% build an xref table by finding the objects.  We also need to find the
% appropriate trailer dictionary.  Note:  One procedure is also used
% even if we do not need to rebuild a PDF file.
%
% This module cannot rebuild a PDF file which has had errors created inside
% of objects or binary data streams.  It often succeeds with files that
% have had its end of lines converted between unix and dos versions.

% if true --> we have an object with duplicate object and generation numbers.
/dup_obj_gen_num //false def

% Note:  This procedure is also used by non-rebuild code.
% Store a line in the xref array (Actually Objects and Generations arrays)
